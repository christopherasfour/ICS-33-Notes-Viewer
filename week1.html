  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  When reading the following material, I suggest that you have Eclipse open,
  including a project with an empty module; then copy/paste some of the code
  below into it, to see what it does. Explore the code by experimenting with
  (changing) it and predicting what results from the changes. I always have an
  Eclipse folder/module named "experiment" open for this purpose.

  This lecture note is long (it is really three lectures), but the information is
  not deep (for ICS-31/ICS-32 graduates). I hope that this is mostly review for
  you, but there are likely to be many things that come up as new (or a few new
  perspectives and connections to the material you already know). Pay close
  attention to the terminology used here, as I will use it (I hope consistently)
  throughout the entire quarter. If you do not know any of these technical terms,
  try looking them up online, or post a message on the "Lecture Material"
  MessageBoard Forum: if you didn't understand a term, probably other students
  didn't as well. Here are 3 quotes relevant to this lecture:

    1) The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names.

    2) He/She who is ashamed of asking is ashamed of learning.

    3) The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new
   eyes. - M. Proust"

  <div id = "binding">
  <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Binding</h1>
  <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
  The process of making a name refer to a value: e.g., x = 1 binds the name x to
  the value 1 (which is an object/instance of the int class); later we can bind
  x to another value (possibly from another class) in another assignment: e.g.,
  x = 'abc'. We speak about "the binding (noun) of a name" to mean the value
  (such values are always objects) that the name is currently associated with
  (or the object the name refers to).

  In Python, every data instance, module, function, and class is an object that
  has a dictionary that stores its namespace: all its internal bindings. We will
  learn much more about namespaces (and how to manipulate them) later in the
  quarter, when we study classes in more detail.

  Typically we illustrate the binding of a name to an object (below, x = 1) as
  follows. We write the name over a rectangle, in which the tail of an arrow is
  INSIDE, specifying the current reference stored for that name: the arrow's head
  refers to a rounded-edge rectangle object labeled by its type (here the class
  it is constructed from) and its value (inside).
  <div class = "diagram">

    x          int
  +---+       (---)
  | --+------>| 1 |
  +---+       (---)
  </div>
  Technically, if we we write x = 1 inside the module m, Python has already
  created an object for module m (we show all objects as rounded-edge rectangles)
  and it puts x, its box, and its binding in the namespace of module m: here, the
  name x is defined inside module m and bound to object 1. That is, we would more
  formally write the result of x = 1 in module m as
  <div class = "diagram">
              module
            (---------)
    m       |    x    |      int
  +---+     |  +---+  |     (---)
  | --+---->|  | --+--+---->| 1 |
  +---+     |  +---+  |     (---)
            (---------)
  </div>

  But often we revert to the previous simpler diagram, when we don't care in what
  module x is defined, focusing solely on x and the object it refers to.

  Note that the del command in Python (e.g., del name) removes a name from the
  current namespace/dictionary of the object in which name is bound. So, writing
  del x inside module m would remove x and its box from m's namspace/dictionary.
  If there was no name x in this module, Python raises an NameError exception. 

  Finally, the "is" operator in Python determines whether two references refer to
  the same object (it is called the (object)identity operator); the == operator
  determines whether two references refer to objects that store the same internal
  state. If a is b is True then a == b must be True (because both a and b refer
  to the same object if a is b is True, and every object has the same state as
  itself.

  If we write

  <div class = "diagram">
    x = ['a','b']
    y = ['a','b']
  </div>

  then x is y is False and x == y is True: the names x and y are bound to/refer
  to two different list objects (each use of [] creates a new list), but these
  two objects store the same state ('a' at index 0; 'b' at index 1).

  <div class = "diagram">
                  list
              (-----------)
    x         |   0   1   |        str
  +---+       | +---+---+ |       (---)
  | --+------>| | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
  +---+       | +-+-+---+ |       (---)
              (---+-------)
                  |
                  v
                 str    
                (---)
                |'a'|
                (---)

                  list
              (-----------)
    y         |   0   1   |        str
  +---+       | +---+---+ |       (---)
  | --+------>| | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
  +---+       | +-+-+---+ |       (---)
              (---+-------)
                  |
                  v
                 str    
                (---)
                |'a'|
                (---)
  </div>

  Technically, the 0 and 1 indexes of the list should share the same string
  objects ('a' and 'b'). This a subtle point that is special to int and str
  objects. I won't care whether you share or duplicate such objects. It is
  intersting to use is to tell what is actually happening:

  <div class = "diagram">
    print(x[0] is y[0], x[1] is y[1], x[0] == y[0], x[1] == y[1])
  </div>

  Likewise, if we write
  <div class = "diagram">
    x = ['a','b']
    y = x
  </div>

  then we create one list object, and bind it to both x and y (assignment y = x
  just copies into name y the reference in name x, making y and x refer to the
  same object). Here, x is y is True (and x == y is therefore True): the names x
  and y refer to the same list object. We would diagram it as

  <div class = "diagram">

    x
  +---+           list
  | --+------>(-----------)
  +---+       |   0   1   |        str
              | +---+---+ |       (---)
    y         | | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
  +---+       | +-+-+---+ |       (---)
  | --+------>(---+-------)
  +---+           |
                  v
                 str    
                (---)
                |'a'|
                (---)
  </div>
  So, pictures can help us understand the differences between these two code
  fragments. You should be able to draw a simple picture of these names and
  objects (both the list and int objects) to illustrate the difference between
  the "is" and == operators.

  The == operator, especially in simple programs, is used much more frequntly
  than the the "is" operator.

  What happens in each example (what picture results) if we execute y[0] = 'c'?
  What would be printed by print(x[0]) in each after such an assignment.

  Finally, if we are in module m1 and we write 

  <div class = "diagram">
  import m2
  </div>

  then we can create/delete names in m2's namespace by writing

  <div class = "diagram">
  m2.x = 3  # create a name x in the namespace of module m2; it refers to int 3
  del m2.x  # delete name x in the namespace of module m2; absent? raise exception
  </div>

  <div id = "statements">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Statements & Expressions</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  The basic unit of speech in English is a sentence: sentences are built from
  noun and verb phrases. In Python the basic unit of code is a statement:
  statements are built from expressions (like a boolean expression in an if
  statement) and other statements (like block statements inside an if statement).

  Statements are executed to cause an effect (e.g., binding/rebinding a name or
  producing output). Expressions are evaluated to compute a result (e.g.,
  computing some formula, numeric, string, boolean, list, etc.). For example, the
  statement x = 1, when executed, causes a binding of the name x to an object
  representing the integer 1. The expression x+1, when evaluated, computes the
  object representing the integer 2. Typically we write expressions inside
  statements: two examples are x = x+1 and print(x+1): both "do something" with
  the computed value x+1 (the first rebinds x to it; the second prints it). The
  distinction between statements and expressions is important in most programming
  languages.  Learn the technical meaning of these terms and be able to recognize
  statements and expressions in statements.

  The print function is a bit strange. We call if for an effect (putting
  characters in the Console window) but like every function, also returns a
  value: when print is called successfully (doesn't raise any exceptions) it
  returns the value None. We typically don't do anything with this value. So,
  we can write the code line

  <div class = "diagram">
  print(x)
  </div>

  which calls the print function (printing something in the Console window) and
  doing nothing with the None value print returns.

  Control structures (even simple sequential ones, like blocks) are considered
  to be statements in Python. Python has rules describing how to execute
  statements. Control structures might contain both statements and expressions.
  The following is a conditional statement using if/else

  <div class = "diagram">
    if x == None:
        y = 0
    else:
        y = 1
  </div>

  This if statement contains the expression x == None and the statements y = 0 and
  y = 1. Technically, x, None, 0 and 1 are "trivial" expressions (which trivially
  compute the object to which x is currently bound, and the object values None,
  0, and 1 which are literals: preconstructed objects "named" by None, 0, and 1).

  The following statement includes a conditional expression that binds a value to
  y: the conditional expression includes the expressions 0 (yes, an object by
  itself, or just a name refering to an object, is a simple expression),
  x == None, and 1.

  <div class = "diagram">
  y = (0 if x == None else 1)
  </div>

  We will discuss conditional statements vs. conditional expressions in more
  detail later in this lecture note.
  </pre>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <div id = "none">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">None</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  None is a value (object/instance) of NoneType; it is the only value of that
  type. Sometimes we use None as a default value for a parameter's argument;
  sometimes we use it as a return value of a function: in fact, a Python function
  that terminates without executing a return statement automatically returns the
  value None. If None shows up as an unexpected result printed in your code or
  more likely in a  raised exception, look for some function whose return value
  you FORGOT to specify explicitly (or whose return statement somehow didn't get
  executed before Python executes the last statement in a function).
  </pre>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <div id = "pass">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Pass</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  pass is the simplest statement in Python; semantically, it means "do nothing".
  Sometimes when we write statements, we aren't sure exactly which ones to write,
  so we might use pass as a placeholder until we write the actual statement we
  need. Often, in tiny examples, we use pass as the meaning of a function.

  <div class = "diagram">
    def f(x) : pass     or     def f(x) :
                                 pass
  </div>

  If you are ever tempted to write the first if statement below, don't; instead
  write the second one, which is simpler: but, they produce equivalent results.

  <div class = "diagram">
  if a in s:      # DON'T write this code
        pass
    else:
        print(a,'is not in',s)


    if a not in s:    # Write this code instead; it is equivalent
        print(a,'is not in',s)    # and simpler; strive to use Python simply
  </div>

  </pre>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <div id = "importing">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Importing: 5 Forms</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  There are five import forms; you should know what each does, and start to think
  about which is appropriate to use in any given situation. Note that in EBNF (a
  notation used to describe programming languages, which we will discuss soon)
  [...] means option and {...}  means repeat 0 or more times, although this
  second form is sometimes written (...)* when describing the syntax of Python.

  Fundamentally, import statements bind names to objects (one or both of which
  come from the imported module).

  <div class = "diagram">
    "import module-name" form: one or more modules, optionally renaming each
    1. import module-name{,module-name}
    2. import module-name [as alt-name] {,module-name [as alt-name]}

  "from module-name import" form: one or mor attributes, optionally renaming each
    3. from module-name import attr-name{,attr-name}
    4. from module-name import attr-name [as alt-name] {,attr-name [as alt-name]}
    5. from module-name import *
  </div>

  Above, alt-name is an alternative name to be bound to the imported object;
  attr-name is an attribute name already defined in the namespace of the module
  from which attr-name is imported.

  The "import module-name" forms import the names of modules (not their attribute
  names). (1) bind each module-name to the object representing that imported
  module-name. (2) bind each alt-name to the object representing its preceding
  imported module-name. Using a module name, we can refer to its attributes using
  periods, such as by module-name.attribute-name

  The "from module-name import" forms don't import a module-name, but instead
  import some/all attribute names defined/bound inside module-name. (3) bind each
  attr-name to the object bound to that attr-name in module-name. (4) bind each
  alt-name to the object bound to the preceding attr-name in module-name. (5)
  bind each name that is bound in module-name to the same object it is bound to
  in module-name.

  Import (like an assignment, and a def, and a class definition) creates a name
  (if that name is not already in the namespace) and binds it to an object: the
  "import module-name" form binds names to module objects; the "from module-name
  import" form binds names to objects (instances, functions, modules, classes,
  etc.) defined inside modules (so now two modules contain names -maybe the same,
  maybe different, depending on which of form 3 or 4 is use- bound to the same
  objects).

  The key idea as to which kind of import to use is to make it easy to refer to a
  name but not pollute the name space of the module doing the importing with too
  many names (which might conflict with other names in that module).

  If a lot of different names in the imported module are to be used, or we want
  to make it clear when an attribute name in another module is used, use the
  "import module-name" form (1) and then qualify the names when used: for example

  <div class = "diagram">
    import random
    # use:  random.choice(...)  and  random.randint(...)
  </div>

  If the imported module-name is too large for using repeatedly, use an
  abbreviaton by importing using an alt-name (2) : for example

  <div class = "diagram">
    import high_precision_math as hp_math
    # use:  hp_math.sqrt(...)
  </div>

  If only one name (or a few names) are to be used from a module, use the
  form (3):

  <div class = "diagram">
    from random import choice, randint
    # use: choice(...)  and  randint(...)
  </div>

  Again, use alt-name to simplify either form, if the name is too large and
  unwieldy to use. Such names are often very long to be clear, but awkward to use
  many times at that length. Generally we should apply the Goldilocks principle:
  name lengths shouldn't be too short (devoid of meaning) or too long (awkward to
  read/type) but their length should be "just right". Better to make them too
  long, because there are ways (such as alt-name) to abbreviate them.

  We almost never write the * form of importing. It imports all the names defined
  in module-name, and "pollutes" our namespace by defining all sorts of names we
  may or may not use (and even worse, which might conflict and redefine names that
  we have already defined). Better to explicitly import the names needed/used.
  Eclipse marks with a warning any names that are imported but unused.
  </pre>
  </div>

  <div id = "iteration">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Directly iterating over values in a list vs.
    Using a range to iterate over indexes of values in a list</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  We know that we can iterate (with a for loop) over ranges: e.g., if alist is a
  list, we can write

  <div class = "diagram">
  alist = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
  for i in range(len(alist)):          # same as for i in range(0,len(alist)):
      print(alist[i])
  </div>

  Here i takes on the values 0, 1, ... , len(alist)-1 but not len(alist), which
  is 6. The code above prints all six values in alist: alist[0], alist[1], ....
  alist[5].

  Often we want to iterate over all the values in a list (alist) but don't need to
  know/use their indexes at all: e.g., to print all the values in a list we can
  use the loop

  <div class = "diagram">
    for v in alist:
      print(v)
  </div>

  which is much better (simpler/clearer/more efficient) than the loop

  <div class = "diagram">
  for i in range(len(alist)):
      print(alist[i])
  </div>

  although both produce the same result. Generally, choose to write the simplest
  loop possible (the one with the fewest details) for all your code. Sometimes you
  might write a loop correctly, but then realize that you can also write a
  simpler loop correctly: change your code to the simpler loop. Sometimes (when
  doing more complicated index processing) we must iterate over indexes. Always
  try to use the simplest tool needed to get the job done.

  In many cases where using range is appropriate, we want to go from the low to
  high value INCLUSIVELY. I have written function named irange (for Inclusive
  RANGE) that we can import from the goody module and use like range.

  <div class = "diagram">
  from goody import irange
  for i in irange(1,10):
      print(i)

  prints the values 1 through 10 inclusive; range(1,10) would print only 1
  through 9. One goal for ICS-33 is to show you how to write alternatives to
  built-in Python features; we will study how irange is written later in the
  quarter, but you can import and use it now (and examine its definition in the
  goody module).

  I have also written frange in goody, which allows iteration over
  floating point (not int) values.

  <div class = "diagram">
  from goody import frange
  for x in frange(0., 1., .5):
      print(x)
  </div>

  prints (iterating from 0 to 1 in steps of .5

  <div class = "diagram">
  0.0
  0.5
  1.0
  </div>

  There are some interesting numerical issues to think about when we use floating
  point number:

  <div class = "diagram">
  from goody import frange
  for x in frange(0., 1., .2):
      print(x)
  </div>

  which prints

  <div class = "diagram">
  0.0
  0.2
  0.4
  0.6000000000000001
  0.8
  1.0
  </div>

  Python tries to print floating point values simply, but sometimes it cannot
  exactly represent a value, so it prints a value that is a tiny bit lower or
  higher. Don't be confused by such numbers.

  <div id = "arg_param">
  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Arguments and Parameters</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  Whenever we DEFINE a function (and define methods in classes), we specify the
  names of its PARAMETERS in its header (in parentheses, separated by commas).
  Whenever we CALL a function we specify the values of its ARGUMENTS (also in
  parentheses, separated by commas). The definition below

  <div class = "diagram">
    def f(x,y):
      return x**y
  </div>

defines a function of two parameters: x and y. When we define a function we
(re)bind the function's name to the function's object. This is similar to what
happens when we write x = 1 (which (re)binds a name to a data object: an
instance of the int class; if we later write x = 2 we rebind x to a different
object).

Calling  f(5,2*6) calls this function with two arguments: the arguments 5 and
2*6 are evaluated (producing objects) and the values/objects computed from
these arguments (5 and 12) are bound to their matching parameters in the
function header (and then the body of the function is executed). Therefore, 
function calls happen in three steps: 
  (1) evaluate the arguments
  (2) bind the argument values (objects) to the parameter names
  (3) execute the body of the function, using the values bound to the parameter
      names; so parameters are names inside the name-space of the function,
      along with any local variables the function defines.

We will discuss the details of argument/parameter binding in much more detail
later in these lecture notes, but in a simple example like this one, parameter/
argument binding occurs sequential, binding the first evaluated argument to the
first parameter, the second evaluated argument to the second parameter (etc.).
It is like writing: x = 5 and then y = 2*6 which binds the parameter x to the
object 5 and then the paramter y to the object 12.

Sometimes we can use the parameter of a function as an argument to another
function call inside its body. If we define

<div class = "diagram">
  def factorial_sum(a,b):
    return factorial(a) + factorial(b)
</div>

Here the parameters a and b of factorial_sum function are used as arguments in
the two calls in its body to the factorial function.

Parameters are always names. Arguments are expressions that evaluate to objects.
Very simple expressions include literals (such as 1 and 'abc') and any names
bound to values (such as a and b in the calls to factorial above).

It is important that you understand the distinction between the technical term
PARAMETER and ARGUMENT, and that calling a function first BINDS that argument
values to to their associated parameter names in the functon's  HEADER (we will
discuss the exact rules later in this lecture note) and then EXECUTES the BODY
of the function. Be familar with these related technical terms.
</pre>

<hr>

<div id = functioncalls>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Function calls ... always include ()
  how we can pass a function as an argument to another function</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Any time a reference to an object is followed by (...) it means to perform a
function call on that object. Some objects will raise an exception if they do
not support function calls: writing 3() or 'abc'() will both raise exceptions.
Calling 'abc'() raises the TypeError exception, with the description: 'str'
object is not callable.

While this rule is simple to understand for the functions that you have been
writing and calling, there are some much more interesting ramifications of this
simple rule. Run the following code to define these three functions.

<div class = "diagram">
def double(x):
    return 2*x

def triple(x):
    return 3*x

def times10(x):
    return 10*x
</div>

Note that each def defines the name of a function and binds that name to the
function object that follows it.

If we then wrote

<div class = "diagram">
  f = double
</div>

then f would become a defined name that is bound to the same (function) object
that the name double is bound to (like like writing y = x if x were bound to an
integer). The expression "f is double" would evaluate to True, because these
two names are bound to the same function object.

Note that there are no () in the code above, so there is no function CALL here:
we are just binding names to objects (that happen to be function objects). If
we instead wrote f = double(3), then Python would bind f to the int value 6.

Given the assignment f = double above, 

<div class = "diagram">
  print(f(5))
</div>

Python would print 10, just as it would if we wrote

<div class = "diagram">
  print(double(5))
</div>

because f and double refer to the same function object, and it makes no
difference whether we call that function object using the name f or double. The
function call does not occur until we use (). Of course the () in print(...)
means that the print function is also called: print's argument is the result
returned by calling f(5). So the two sets of () in th print( f(5) ) means that
Python calls two functions while executing print.

Here is a more intersting example, but using exactly the same idea.

<div class = "diagram">
  for f in [double, triple, times10]:
    print( f(5) )
</div>

Here f is a variable that iterates over (is bound to) all the values in a list
(we could also have used a tuple to store these three functions): each value in
the list is a reference to a function object (the objects referred to by the
names double, triple, and times10). This code in the loop's body prints the
values computed by calling each of these function objects with the argument 5.
Note that these functions are NOT called when creating the list (no parentheses
there!): the list is just built to contain references to these three function
objects: again, when their names are not followed by () there is no function
call. This code prints 10, 15, and 50.

See the "Creating;/Using a List of Functions" link on the Weekly Schedule to see
a picture of how this code works.

Using the same logic, we could also write a dictionary whose keys are strings
and whose values are function objects, and then use a string as a key needed to
retrieve and call its associated function object.

<div class = "diagram">
fs = {'x2' : double, 'x3' : triple, 'x10' : times10}
print( fs['x3'](5) )
</div>

Here fs is a dictionary that stores keys that are strings and associates each
with a function object: there are no calls to functions when building the
dictionary for fs in the first statement - no (); we then can retrieve the
function associated with any key (here the key 'x3') and then call the resulting
function object (here fs['x3']) with the argument 5. Of course in the second
statement we use the () to call the function selected from the dictionary.

We can also pass (uncalled) functions as arguments to other functions.

<div class = "diagram">
# p is a predicate: a 1-argument function returning a bool (True or False)
# alist is a list of values on which p can be/is called
# count_true returns the number ov values in alist for which p returns True
def count_true(p, alist): 
    count = 0
    for x in alist:
        if p(x):
            count += 1

    return count
</div>

if we wrote the following (predicate is a module in the ICS-33 course library)

<div class = "diagram">
  from predicate import is_prime
</div>

(which imports the is_prime function from the predicates module: a PREDICATE is
a function of one argument that returns a boolean value) then calling

<div class = "diagram">
    count_true(is_prime, [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
</div>

returns 4: only the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7, are prime. 

Note that the parameter p is bound to the function object that is_prime is
bound to (is_prime is not called when it is specified as an argument), and p
is called many times inside the count_true function: one for each value in the
list. We call count_true a "functional" because it is passed a function as an
argument.

In summary

<div class = "diagram">
  def f(x):
    return 2*x
</div>

is really just a special syntax for creating a name f and binding it to a new
function object (not using an = sign, which we normally using for defining
names).

Note the difference between the following, which both print 6. Both g and f
refer to the same function object (by the "is" operator, f is g is True). The
call g(3) is calling the same function object as the call f(3).

<div class = "diagram">
x = f(3)
print(x)
</div>

and
<div class = "diagram">
g = f
print(g(3))
</div>

A large part of this course deals with understanding functions better, including
but not restricted to function calls: the main thing -but not the only thing-
one does with functions; the other main things are passing functions as
arguments to other functions (as in count_true) and returning functions from
other functions (discussed soon).

So, functions are objects just like integers are objects. Both can have one or
more names bound to them. In fact, is some branches of mathematics 3 is
considered just the name of a parameterless function: we can call 3() to get
its value (although don't try this in Python).

<div id = scope>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Scope: Global and Local Names (generalized in the next section)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
The topic of SCOPE concerns the visibility of variable names: when a name is
written in Python code, to what definition of that name does it refer. In this
section, we discuss whether naming a variable in a simple context refers to a
name defined in the global scopre or local scope; in the next, we generalize
this principle in a powerful way, allowing for the creation of functions that
return other functions.

Names defined in a module are global definitions; names defined in a function
(including its parameters, and later names defined in a class) are local
definitions. In a module, we can refer to global names, but not any local names
inside the functions/class that are define there. In functions we can refer
both to their local names or to global names. Of particular interest is what
happens when a name is defined bothglobally and locally.

Here are Python's rules (not all the rules yet, but the ones we focus on
now, and correct/expand later), which we will discuss and illustrate below.

  1) A name used (to lookup or bind) in a module is global

  2) A name used (to lookup or bind) in a function is global if 
      a) that name is explicitly declared global (e.g., global x) PRIOR to its
           use in the function, OR
      b) that name is only looked-up (and never bound) in the function

  3) A name used (to lookup or bind) in a function is local, otherwise
       (e.g., bound in a function AND not declared global before its use)
       
As a result of these rules, all uses of a name in a given function must be the
same: all uses are global or all uses are local.

Let's start by looking at Example 1: 

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
print(x)
</div>

which prints 1. Here the module defines a global name x (by rule 1) and binds
it to the object 1 and prints the value bound to that global name.

Now let's look at Example 2: 

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
def f():
    print(x)

f()
print(x)
</div>

which prints 1 and then 1. Here the module defines a global name x (by rule 1)
and binds it to the object 1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and
binds it to a function object: note the function uses the name x, which is
global (by rule 2b). When we call f(), it prints the value bound to the global
name x. Then, returning to the module, it prints the value bound to the global
name x (again, by rule 1).

In this example, all the uses (there is just one) of x inside the function is
global.

Now let's look at Example 3: 

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
def f():
    x = 2
    print(x)

f()
print(x)
</div>

which prints 2 and then 1. Here the module defines a global name x (by rule 1)
and binds it to the object 1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and
binds it to a function object: note the function uses the name x twice, which
is local (by rule 3: it is bound in the function and is not declared global in
the functioni). When we call f(), it binds the local name x to 2 and then
prints the value bound to the local name x. Then, returning to the module, it
prints the value bound to the global name x (by rule 1), which is still 1.

What is the primary difference between this example and the preceding one? Here,
both uses of the name x in this function are local (not global).

Now let's look at Example 4: 

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
def f():
    y = 2
    print(x,y)

f()
print(x)
</div>

which prints 1 2 and then 1. Here the module defines a global name x (by rule 1)
and binds it to the object 1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and
binds it to a function object: note the function uses the names x and y; x is
global (by rule 2b) and y is local (by rule 3). When we call f(), it binds the
local name y to 2 and then prints the values bound to the global name x and the
local name y. Then, returning to the module, it prints the value bound to the
global name x (by rule 1).

Note that if we replaced print(x) at the end of the module with print(x,y)
Python would raise a NameError exception because there is no global name y;
y is a local name defined only in the function f.

Something interesting happens by the rules above, if we try to get function f
to not only print the original value of the global name x, but also try to
rebind that global name to 2. Let's see why this fails to be the effect of the
code below (later we will see how to accomplish this task). In fact, it fails in
an interesting way.

Now let's look at Example 5: 

<div class = "diagram">

x = 1     # wrong code to print a global and then change it
def f():    # wrong code to print a global and then change it
    y = 2   # wrong code to print a global and then change it
    print(x,y)    # wrong code to print a global and then change it
    x = 2   # wrong code to print a global and then change it
            # wrong coed to print a global and then change it
f()         # wrong code to print a global and then change it
print(x)    # wrong code to print a global and then change it

</div>

Here, the module defines a global name x (by rule 1) and binds it to the object
1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and binds it to a function
object: note the function uses the names x and y; x is local (by rule 3; it is
bound in the function and not declared global) and y is local (also by rule 3,
ditto). When we call f(), it binds the local name y to 2 and then tries to
print the values bound to the local names x and y; but here there is no binding
(yet) for x -even though Python knows that x must be local- so Python raises the
UnboundLocalError exception: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment.

So, it does NOT look-up x as a global in the print and then define x as a local!
The name x is either always global or always local in a function.

---------------
If we put the x = 2 before the print, it doesn't raise an exception, but doesn't
rebind the global name x either.

Now let's look at Example 6: 

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1     # wrong code
def f():    # wrong code
    y = 2   # wrong code
    x = 2   # wrong code
    print(x,y)    # wrong code
          # wrong code
f()         # wrong code
print(x)    # wrong code
</div>

Python would print 2 2 and then 1. Here, the module defines a global name x
(by rule 1) and binds it to the object 1; then it defines a global name f (by
rule 1) and binds it to a function object: note the function uses the names x
and y; x is local (by rule 3; it is bound in the function and not declared
global) and y is local (also by rule 3, ditto). When we call f(), it binds the
local name y to 2 and binds the local name x to 2. Then it print the values
bound to the local names x and y. Then, returning to the module, it prints the
value bound to the global name x (which has remained bound to 1).
---------------

We can change the value in the global name x by using a "global" declaration
before x is used inside f. This declaration means that x should always be
treated as a global name inside this function (whether it is examined or
bound to an object, or both) by rule 2.

Now let's look at Example 7: 
<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
def f():
    global x
    y = 2
    print(x,y)
    x = 2

f()
print(x)
</div>
Python would print 1 2 and then print 2 (thus changing the global name x).

Here, the module defines a global name x (by rule 1) and binds it to the object
1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and binds it to a function
object: note the function uses the names x and y; x is global (by rule 2a; it is
declared global) and y is local (by rule 3, it is bound in the function but not
declared global). When we call f(), it binds the local name y to 2 and then
prints the values bound to the global name x and the local name y. Then it
rebinds the global name x to 2. Finally, returning to the module, it prints the
value bound to the global name x (which has now been rebound to 2).

So, if a function must (re)bind a global name, the functioin must explicitly
declare that name global.

Note that we we wrote "global x" after print(x,y) in f, this x would be
considered a local name (rule 2a does not apply), so Python would instead raise
a SyntaxError: name 'x' is used prior to global declaration.

To repeat, when Python creates an function object, it first scans the whole
function to determine whether a name refers to a global name or a local
name, looking for global declarations and bindings to make this determination,
using the rules stated above. The rule for 2a hinges on the word PRIOR. So if
is declared global subsequent to its first use, it is considered to be in error.

In summary, we can always lookup (find the value of, evaluate) a global name
inside a function to find its value without doing anything special, but if we
want to (re)bind the global name to a new value inside the function, we must
declare the name global somewhere in the function (before its first use). If we
forget to declare the name global and (re)bind the name, Python will instead
define it as a local name (rule 3) and all occurrences of that name in the
function will use it as a local name (so it better be defined first).

What do you think the following code will do? Notice that is similar to the code
above, but it does not define a global name x before defining f. Can you explain
why (in terms of the rules) it does what it does?

Now let's look at Example 8: 
<div class = "diagram">
def f():
    global x
    x = 2
    y = 2
    print(x,y)
f()
print(x)
</div>
Also can you explain what would happen if the print statement print(x,y) were
moved between the statements y = 2 and x = 2, ore moved before both?

Bottom Line: You should understand how Python decides whether names in a
function are global or local. TYPICALLY, no global names should be used: all
information that a function uses should be passed into the function and bound to
its parameters. BUT if a function must (re)bind a global name either

<div class = "info">
  (1) the name should be declared global (so it can be examined/changed), or 

  (2) the function should be called like global-name = f(...) so that the
      global name is not declared/changed as a global inside the function, but 
      is instead changed as a result of an assignment statement made after
      calling the function. We can even use this mechanism for rebinding
      multiple global names: gn1, gn2, ..., gnN = f(...) where f returns an
      N-tuple or N-list (see the Parallel/Tuple/List Assignment -aka sequence
      unpacking- section below).
</div>
<div class = "warning">
Problem 1: Explain why we cannot write a general function in Python that
exchanges the references in its argument names. That is, we cannot write
def f(x,y):
  ...
such that
a = 1
b = 2
f(a,b)
print(a,b) # prints 2 and 1
</div>
Such a function canno be written in Java, but can be written in C++.

<div class = "warning">
Problem 2: Write a SPECIFIC function in Python that exchanges the references
ONLY FOR THE NAMES a AND b. That is,

def f():
  ...
such that
a = 1
b = 2
f()
print(a,b) # prints 2, and 1

Problem 3: Write a GENERAL function in Python that we can CALL IN A SPECIAL WAY
to exchanges the references of its two argument names. Hint: read the paragraph
above.

def f(x,y):
  ...
a = 1
b = 2
# some Python statement, calling f(a,b) such that
print(a,b) # prints 2, and 1
</div>
These local/global rules are generalized in the next section to include 4
different locations/scopes: LEGB
  1) functions (Local scope)
  2) enclosing functions (Enclosing scope)
  3) modules (Global scope)
  4) the special builtins module (Builtins scope)
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "legb">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">LEGB Rule</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Look at the following functions, which all define a local function (and define
local variables too), and then return the value of that local function. This
feature in Python (and the feature of passing function objects as arguments to
parameters; see the count_true function defined earlier) are very powerful and
useful. In this section, we will generalize the scope rules discused above and
learn how these new rules apply when functions defined in functions are called).

<div class = "diagram">
def bigger_than(age):
    def test_it(x):
        return x > age

    return test_it

def running_average1():
    data = []              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include

    def include_it(x):
        data.append(x)     #   mutate data's list
        return sum(data)/len(data)

    return include_it

def running_average2():
    sum   = 0              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include
    count = 0              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include

    def include_it(x):
        nonlocal sum,count
        sum += x           #   rebind sum
        count+= 1          #   rebind count
        return sum/count

    return include_it
</div>

Note that the body of these functions, and the bodies of their inner functions
(test_it and include_it) can also use global names (as discused in the last
section); but none of these do, which follows good practice for defining any
functions.

We will now write the complete rules Python uses to look up and bind names.
Thes rules generalizes what we learned in the previous section: we will now
define any name in a function as either local, nonlocal/encloseing, global, or
LEGB; then we will learn how such names are looked-up and bound. Here are the
rules from the previous sections, restated and extended using these new terms.
We separate rules into how names are classified and how they are
looked-up/bound.

<div class = "info">
  1) A name used in a module is global

  2) A name used in a function is global if that name is explicitly declared
      global (e.g., global x) PRIOR to its use in the function

  3) A name used in a function is nonlocal/enclosing if that name is explicitly
      declared nonlocal (e.g., nonlocal x) prior to its use in that function

  4) A name used in a function is local
       a) that name is a parameter in that function, or
       b) that name is bound anywhere in that function (and is neither declared
          global nor nonlocal)

  5) Otherwise, a name is LEGB (if it is none of the above)
     NOTE: an LEGB name can NEVER be bound in a function (if it is bound, it
       must be declared global, or nonlocal, or will be local by 4a or 4b). 
     So LEGB names are ONLY LOOKED-UP.
</div>
If we import a module name (call it M), then we can lookup/rebind any global
name defined in that module (call it n) by writing M.n: e.g., print(M.n) or
M.n = ...

Here are the corresponding rules for looking-up/binding all these names.
<div class = "info">
  A+B) When a name is global,
       1) Python LOOKS UP that name, in order, 
             a) in the Global scope; and if not found
             b) in the Builtins scope (in the builtins module); and if not found
             c) raises NameError
       2) Python BINDS that name in the Global scope
     
  C) When a name is nonlocal/enclosing, Python looks for the name in the scope
     of the function enclosing it (if there is one); if it doesn't find it
     there, it looks in the scope of the function enclosing the enclosing
     function (if there is one). This process continues outward until it finds
     the name and then uses the name in that scope. If it cannot find the name
     and reaches the global scope, Python raises a SyntaxError exception: no
     binding for nonlocal ... found

  D) When a name is local, Python looks-up/binds that name in the local scope.

  E) When a name is LEGB, Python looks for the name, in order,
       1) in the        Local scope of the function; and if not found 
       2) in any of the Enclosing scopes (see rules in C); and if not found
       3) in the        Global scope; and if not found
       4) in the        Builtins scope(in the builtins module); and if not found
       5) raises NameError
</div>
For example, the code

<div class = "diagram">
x = 1
def f(y):
    print(x,y)

f(2)
print(x)
</div>
prints 1 2 and then 1. Here the module defines a global name x (by rule 1)
and binds it to the object 1; then it defines a global name f (by rule 1) and
binds it to a function object: note the function uses the names print, x and y
(yes, now we even look at where the name print comes from); print is LEGB (by
rule 5), x is LEGB (by rule 5) and y is local (by rule 4a). After the function
definition the name f is global (by rule 1) and the the name print is LEGB (by
rule 5) and the name x is global (by rule 1).

When we call f(2),

Python looks up the global name f and finds it in the global scope where it is
declared and calls that function, first binding its local name y to the object
2; then it executes the body of the function. It looks up the object associated
with the LEGB name print (which it finds not in the local scope, not in an
enclosing scope -there is none-, not in the global scope, but finally in the
builtins scope): the print function is defined in the builtins module. It then
calls the print function after looking up the binding of the LEGB name x (which
it finds not in the local scope, not in an enclosing scope -there is none-, but
finally in the global scope, with a binding 1) and the local name y (it finds
its binding 2, in the local scope). After printing 1 2 the function terminates.

Now, Python looks up the object associated with the global name print (which it
finds not in the global scope, but in the builtins scope). It then looks up the
global name x (which it finds in the global scope, with a binding of 1) and
calls the print function, printing the value 1. The module then terminates.

******
This is an incredibly detailed explanation of what happens, but it is an
accurate description. We will do many more examples in class, but it is up to
you to study these and be able to know/describe/hand-simulate exactly what
happens.

</div>
-----Back to understand a function defined in a function

Now let's return to the three concrete examples of a function defined inside a
function. None of these functions use global or builtin names, so all names are
defined locally or nonlocally (in an enclosing scope, found by the LEGB rule).

The first is function is

<div class = "diagram">
def bigger_than(age):
    def test_it(x):
        return x > age

    return test_it
</div>
Note that inside the function bigger_than, age is a local name (this name is
used only inside test_it). Inside the function test_it, x is a local name and
age is an LEGB name (by rule 5); this is the only place age is used.

Lets look at the following sequence of statements

<div class = "diagram">
old = bigger_than(60)
print(old(65))
</div>
Python executes the first statement by calling bigger_than and then binding the
object that it returns to the variable name old. When calling bigger_than, 
Python first binds the argument 60 to the parameter age, and then executes its
body, whose two statements

<div class = "info">
  (1) define test_it to refer to a NEW function object (new each time
      bigger_than is called). That function object, being enclosed in
      bigger_than, stores a CLOSURE consisting of all the local variables and
      their bindings in bigger_than: here just arge bound to 60. A function
      stores a closure only if it is defined inside an enclosing function, so
      global functions store no closures. We can think of a closure as just a
      dictionary storing variable names and their current bindings.

  (2) return a reference to the function object bound to the local variable
      test_it. In the statement above, the global name old is bound to this
      returned function object.

</div>
When old(65) is called, Python first binds the argument 65 to the parameter x,
and then executes old's body. It is just one return statement, which compares
the local name x to the LEGB name age; it looks-up the value for age inside the
closure of old's function object (where age is bound to 60). Since 65>60
evaluates to True, old(65) returns True, which is printed. (*of course, the
binding of the parameter x inside this function call is 65).

See a link to the picture of a Function returning a function in the lectures
and/or weekly schedule on the course website.

If we wrote the following
<div class = "diagram">
old     = bigger_than(60)
ancient = bigger_than(90)
print (old(10), old(70), old(90), ancient(70), ancient(95))
</div>
Python prints: False True True False True

Each assignment statement binds its name (old and ancient) to a different
function object that is created/returned by different calls to the bigger_than
function. Each of these function objects has its own closure: age is bound to
60 in old's function object's closure; age   s bound to 90 in ancients's
function object's closure. So the LEGB name age in each different function will
get its value from a different closure, so the functions can return different
results.

In fact, we even could have avoided the local variable old and written

<div class = "diagram">
print ( bigger_than(60)(70) )
</div>
We know that bigger_than(60) calls bigger_than with the argument 60, which
returns a result that is a reference to its inner function test_it in whose
closure age is bound to 60; so by writing (70) after that, we are just calling
tht returned function object (the one bigger_than(60) returned). When calling
this returned function object using the argument 70, it returns True.

In the function 
<div class = "diagram">
def running_average1():
    data = []              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include

    def include_it(x):
        data.append(x)     #   mutate data's list
        return sum(data)/len(data)

    return include_it
</div>
the include_it function refers to data, which is an LEGB name, multiple times.
Note that it is an LEGB name in include_it, because it is not bound in that
function. So, each time running_average1 is called, it creates and returns a
new function object bound to include_it, whose closure will contain the name
data bound to an empty list. Each time we call it, it will mutate data by
appending another value to it, and returning the average of all the values it
has been called with (now in the list). For example

<div class = "diagram">
mileage_per_tank = running_average1()
print(mileage_per_tank(300))
print(mileage_per_tank(200))
print(mileage_per_tank(400))
</div>
prints  300 (300/1), 250((300+200)/2), and 300 ((300+200+400)/3)

So, using functions returning functions, a function can remember information
from its previous calls! It stores such information in the closure for its
enclosing function (why the name "closure" is meaningful).

Finally, in the function

<div class = "diagram">
def running_average2():
    sum   = 0              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include
    count = 0              # Mutated, but not rebound, in include

    def include_it(x):
        nonlocal sum,count
        sum += x           #   rebind sum
        count+= 1          #   rebind count
        return sum/count

    return include
</div>
the include_it function refers to sum and count, which because they are BOUND
inside include_it (using +=) would normally be local names. But as local names
they would not be initialized and cause an error. Instead, we want the
include_it function to use the sum/count initialized in running_average2, so
we explicitly declare them nonlocal, so their values will be LOOKED-UP and
REBOUND in the closure for the running_averqage2 function call in which the
include_it function was created.

So, each time running_average2 is called, it creates and returns a new function
object bound to include_it, whose closure will contain the names sum and count
bound to 0. Each time we call it, it will rebind sum and count by incrementing
them, and returning the average of all the values it has been called with.
Thi function has the same behavior as running_average1 by storing just two
integers, without having to remember a list of values. But doing so requires
nonlocal variables.

The bottom line here is that there are complicated rules that govern the scope
of variable names. But they are often used in stardard ways, to get powerful 
behavior from simple Python code.

<div id = "function_methods">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Functions vs Methods: The Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Functions are typically called f(...) while methods are called on objects like
o.m(...). Think of x ='candide' followed by calling print(x.replace('d','p'))

In reality, a method call is just a special syntax to write a function
call. The special "argument" o (normally arguments are written inside the
parentheses) prefixes the method name. Functions and methods are related by
what I call "The Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming."

<div class = "diagram">
  o.m(...)     =     type(o).m(o,...)
</div>

<div class = "info">
On the right side
  1) type(o) returns a reference to the class object o was constructed from.
  2) .m means call the function m declared inside that class: look for
       def m(self,...): .... in the class
  3) pass o as the first argument to m: recall, that when defining methods in
       classes we write def m(self, ....); where does the argument matching the
       self parameter come from? It comes from the object o in calls like
       o.m(...)
</div>
So, calling 'candide'.replace('d','p') is exactly the same as calling
str.replace('candide','d','p'), because type('candide') returns a reference to
the str class, which defines many string methods, including the replace method.

How well do you understand self (or your-self, for that matter:)? This equation
is the key. I believe a deep understanding of this equation is the key to
clarifying many aspects of object-oriented programming in Python (whose objects
are constructed from classes). Just my two cents. But we will often return to
this equation throughout this course. I've never seen any books that talk about
this equation explicitly. We will revisit FEOOP when we spend a week discussing
how to write more sophisticated classes than the ones you wrote in ICS-32.

Oh, by the way, I must say that this equation is true, but not completely true.
As we will later see: (a) if m is in the object o's namespaces, it will be
called directly (bypassing looking in o's class/type), and (b) when we learn
about class inheritance, the inheritance hierarchy of a class provides other
classes in which to look for m if it is not declared directly in o's class/type.
So, as in courtroom testimony, we need to distinguish the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.

But this equation is so simple, clear (once you understand it), and useful
for tons of examples, it is worth memorizing, even if it is not completely
accurate (yet).

<div id = "lambda">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">lambda</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Lambdas are used in expressions where we need a very simple function. A lambda
represents a special function object. Instead of defining a full function (with
a def and a name for it), we can just use a lambda: after the word lambda comes
its parameters separated by commas, then a colon followed by a single EXPRESSION
that computes the value of a lambda (no "return" is needed, and the function
cannot include control structures/statments, not even a sequence of statements).

So, writing ...(lambda x,y : x+y)... in some context

Is just like first defining

<div class = "diagram">
  def f(x,y):
    return x+y
</div>
and then writing ...f... in the same context. That is calling
print( (lambda x,y : x+y)(2,3) ) is the same as calling print( f(2,3) ).

A lambda produces an UNNAMED function object. For example, we can also write the
following code, whose first line binds to the name f the unnamed lambda/function
object, and whose second line calls the unnamed lambda object via the name.

<div class = "diagram">
g = lambda x,y : x+y  # lambdas have one expression after : without a return
print( g(1,3) )
</div>

and Python will print 4. I often put lambdas in parentheses, to more clearly
denote the start and end of the lambda, for example writing

<div class = "diagram">
  g =  (lambda x,y : x+y)
</div>

Using this form, we can write code code above without defining g, writing just

<div class = "diagram">
print( (lambda x,y : x+y)(1,3) )
</div>
In my prompt module (MY PREFERRED WAY OF DOING PYTHON USER-INPUT), there is a
function called for_int that has a parameter that specifies a boolean function
(a function taking on argument and returning a boolean value: we will repeated
use the word predicate for this kind of function) that the int value must
satisfy, to be returned by the prompt (otherwise the for_int function prompts
the user again, for a legal value).

That is, we pass a function object (without calling it) to prompt.for_int,
which CALLS that function on the value the user enters to the prompt, to verify
that the function returns True for that value.

So the following code fragment is guaranteed to store a value between 0 to 5
inclusive in the variable x. If the user enters a value like 7, an error will
be printed and the user reprompted for the information.

<div class = "diagram">
import prompt
x = prompt.for_int('Enter a value in [0,5]', is_legal = (lambda x : 0<=x<=5))
print(x)
</div>
Execute this code in Python.

In a later part of this lecture note, we will see how to use lambdas to
simplify sorting lists (or simplify iterating through any data structures
according to an ordering function).

Again, I often put lambdas in parentheses for clarity: see the prompt.for_int
example above. But there are certain places where lambdas are required to be in
parentheses: assume def g(a,b): ... and the lambda below will receive a 2-tuple
as an argument and return the reversed 2-tuple. Calling
g( 1, (lambda x : x[1],x[0]) ) requires the lambda to be in parentheses, because
without the parentheses it would read as g( 1, lambda x : x[1],x[0] ). In this
function call, Python would think that x[0] was a third argument (not part of
the lambda) to function g, which would raise an exception when called, because
g defined only two parameters. Of course, we could also use different
parentheses in the call and write g( 1, lambda x : (x[1],x[0]) ). We also wrote
this call above as g( 1, (lambda x : x[1],x[0]) ). In both cases the
parentheses remove the ambiguity.

In a previous section (functions returning functions) we wrote the code
<div class = "diagram">
def bigger_than(age):
    def test_it(x) :
        return x > age
    return test
</div>
We defined the test_it function just so we could return a reference to it. Now,
because the test_it function is so simple, and the only place we refer to it by
name is in the return statement, we can simplify this code by returning a
lambda instead of defining/returning a named function:

<div class = "diagram">
def bigger_than(age) :
    return (lambda x : x > age)
</div>
So, in each version of the bigger_than function, it returns a reference to a
function object.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "unpacking">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Parallel/Tuple/List Assignment (aka sequence unpacking)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">

Note that we can write code like the following: here both x,y and 1,2 are
implicit tuples; and we can unpack them as follows
<div class = "diagram">
x,y = 1,2
</div>
In fact, you can replace the left hand side of the equal sign by either (x,y) or
[x,y] and replace the right hand side of the equal sign by either (1,2) or [1,2]
and x gets assigned 1 and y get assigned 2: even (x,y) = [1,2] works correctly.

In most programming languages (including Java and C++), to exchange the values
of two variables x and y we write three assignments (can you prove that writing
just x = y followed by y = x fails to exchange these values?):
<div class = "diagram">
temp = x
x    = y
y    = temp
</div>
Problem: why would x = y followed by y = x not do the swapping?

In Python we can write this code using one tuple assignment

<div class = "diagram">
x,y = y,x
</div>

<div class = "info">
To do any parallel assignment, Python
  (a) first computes all the values of the expressions/objects on the right
        (1 and 2 from the top)
  (b) second binds each name on the left (x then y) to these computed
        values/objects (binds x to 2, then bind y to 1)
</div>
This is similar to how Python calls functions: first evaluating all the
arguments and then binding them to all the parameters.

This is also called "sequence unpacking assignment": both tuples and list are
considered kinds of sequences (where order is important) in Python. Note that
x,y = 1,2,3 and x,y,z = 1,2 would both raise ValueError exceptions, because
there are different numbers of names and values to bind to them. We will
frequently use simple forms of parallel/unpacking assignment when looping
through items in dictionaries (illustated below; used extensively later in this
lecture note), but even more complicated forms are possible: for example.

<div class = "diagram">
l,m,(n,o) = (1, 2, [3,4])
print(l,m,n,o)
</div>
prints: 1 2 3 4

Here, each name is bound to one int value. Python also allows writing

<div class = "diagram">
a,*b,c = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(a,b,c)
</div>
which prints as: 1 [2, 3, 4] 5

Here, * can preface any name; the name is bound to a sequence of any number of
values, so as to correctly bind a and c. That is, *b would need to bind to a
sequence of all but the first and last value. We could not write

<div class = "diagram">
*a,*b,c = [1,2,3,4,5]
</div>
because there is no unique way to bind a, b, and c: for example a=1, b=[2,3,4],
and c=5 works; but so does a=[1,2],b=[3,4],c=5. 

In fact, we can write complicated parallel assignments with multiple *s like

<div class = "diagram">
l,(*m,n),*o  = (1, ['a','b','c'], 2, 3,4)
print(l,m,n,o)
</div>
so long as there is a unique way to decide what the * variables bind to.

The above statement prints as: 1 ['a', 'b'] c [2, 3, 4]

Generally sequence unpacking assignment is useful if we have a complex
tuple/list structure and we want to bind names to its components, to refer to
these components more easily by these names: each name binds to part of the
complicated structure.

As another example, if we define a function that returns a tuple

<div class = "diagram">
def reverse(a,b) :
    return (b,a)    # we could also write just return b,a
</div>
we can also write x,y = reverse(x,y) to also exchange these values.

Finally, one of the most common ways to use unpacking assignment is in for
loops: for example, we can write the following for loop to print the sum of
each triple in the list

<div class = "diagram">
for i,j,k in [(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)]:
    print (i+j+k)
</div>
this is much simpler and clearer than using one name for the entire tuple, and
then indexing that one name.

<div class = "diagram">
for t in [(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)]:
    print (t[0] + t[1] + t[2])
</div>
The loop above assigns i, j, and k the three values in each 3-tuple in the list
that the for loop is iterating over. We will see more about such assignments
when  iterating though items in dictionaries. A preview is

<div class = "diagram">
for k,v in d.items():  #d is any dictionary
    print(k,'->',v)    #  print its key and value pairs (abbreviated k,v)
</div>
which prints each key and its associated value for each item (each key/value
association) that we are iterating through in a dictionary.

<div class = "diagram">
d = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}
for k,v in d.items():
    print(k,'->',v)
</div>
prints

d -> 4
a -> 1
c -> 3
b -> 2

although the keys/values may print in any order

This is simpler than the following loop, which iterates over the tuples
produced when iterating over d.items().

<div class = "diagram">
for t in d.items():         #d is any dictionary
    print(t[0],'->',t[1])   #  print its key (t[0])and value (t[1]) pairs
</div>
When you write for loops that loop over complicated data (as in dictionary
items), use multiple variables to name the indvidual parts of the data.
Multiple names for the parts often make the loop body's code easier to write
and understand. Students often fail to follow this advice and eventually get
docked points for writing code that is more complicated than needed.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "iterable">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Iterable</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
When we specify that an argument of a function must be iterable, it might be one
of the standard data structures in Python: str, list, tuple, set, dict. All
these data structures are iterable: we can iterate over the values they contain
by using a simple for loop.

But we will learn other Python features (classes and generators) that are also
iterable. The difference is, that for standard Python data structures we can
call the "len" function on them and index them  [...]; but for general iterable
arguments we CANNOT call "len" nor index them: we can only iterate over their
values with a for loop: getting the first value, the second value, etc. (never
knowing when there won't be a next value). Later in the quarter we will learn
how to call iter and next explicitly on iterables; for loops implicitly call
these two functions on iterables.

Also, we can always use a comprehension (dicussed later in this lecture) to
transform any iterable into a list or tuple of its values, doing so takes up
extra time and space, and should be avoided unless necessary. But learning how
to convert an iterable into a list or tuple is instructive.

<div id = "sort">

First, we will examine the following similar definitions of sort/sorted. Then we
will learn the differences between these similar and related features below.

<div class = "info">
(1) sort is a method defined on arguments that are LIST objects; it returns
      None but MUTATES its list argument to be in some specified order:
      e.g., alist.sort() or alist.sort(reverse=True); note that calling
      print(alist.sort()) sorts (mutates)  alist and prints None (sort's
      returned value).

(2) sorted is a function defined on arguments that are any ITERABLE object; it
      returns a LIST of its argument's values, in some specified order. The
      argument itself is NOT MUTATED: e.g., sorted(adict) or
      sorted(adict,reverse=True). Neither changes adict to be sorted, because
      dictionaries are never sorted; both produce a LIST of sorted keys in
      adict. We can also call sorted with an argument that is a str, list,
      tuple, set, ... anything that is iterable in Python.
</div>
So, the sort method can be applied only to lists, but the sorted function can
be applied to any iterable (str, list, tuple, set, dict, etc.) 

For example, if votes is the list of 2-tuples (candidates, votes) below, we can
execute the following code.

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
votes.sort()
for c,v in votes:                         # note parallel/unpacking assignment
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
print(votes)
</div>
The call votes.sort() uses the sort METHOD to sort the LIST (MUTATE it); then
the for loop iterates over this newly-ordered list and prints the information
in the list in the order it now appears. When the entire votes list is printed
after the loop, we see the list has been MUTATED and is now sorted. It prints

<div class = "diagram">
Candidate Able received 10 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
[('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Charlie', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
</div>
We will see why it sorts by name soon, and learn how to use the key argument to
sort by anything else (say by votes).
Contrast this with the following code.

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes):                 # note parallel/unpacking assignment
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
print(votes)
</div>
Here we never sort/mutate the votes list. Instead we use the sorted FUNCTION,
which takes an ITERABLE argument (a LIST is iterable) and returns a NEW LIST
that is sorted (leaving votes unchanged). Then we iterate over that returned
list to print its information (which is a sorted version of votes). But here,
when we print the votes list at the end, we see that the votes list remained
unchanged. It prints

<div class = "diagram">
Candidate Able received 10 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
[('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
</div>
The sorted function can be thought of as first iterating over the parameter,
creating a temporary list; then sorting that temprorary list; and finally
returning the sorted temporary list: sorted mutates the list it creates
internally; it does not mutate the argument matching iterable.

So, we can think of the sorted function to be defined by

<div class = "diagram">
def sorted (iterable):
  alist = list(iterable)  # create a list with all the iterable's values
  alist.sort()      # sort that list using the sort method for lists
  return alist      # return the sorted list
</div>

<div class = "warning">
Question: What would the following code do? If you understand the definitions
above, you won't be fooled and the answer won't suprise you. Hint: what does
votes.sort() return vs. sorted(votes)?

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in votes.sort():
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
print(votes)
</div>
</div>
If we were going to print some list in a sorted form many times, it would be
more efficient to sort/mutate it once, and then use a regular for loop on that
sorted list (either mutate the original or create a new, sorted list and use it
multiple time). But if we needed to keep the list in a certain order and care
about space efficiency and/or don't care as much about time efficiency, we
would not sort/mutate the list and instead call the sorted function whenever we
need to process the list in a sorted order.

Note that if we store votes_dict as a dict data structure (a dictionary
associating candidates with the number of votes they received), and then tried
to call the sort method on it, Python would raise an exception

<div class = "diagram">
votes_dict = {'Charlie': 20, 'Able': 10, 'Baker': 20, 'Dog': 15}
votes_dict.sort()

  AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'sort'
</div>
The problem is: the sort method is defined only on LIST class objects, not
DICT class objects.

So, Python cannot execute votes_dict.sort()! It makes no sense to sort a
dictionary. In fact, we cannot sort strings (they are immutable); we cannot
sort tuples (their order is immutable); we cannot sort sets (they have no order,
which actually allows them to operate more efficiently; we'll learn why later
in the quarter); we cannot sort dicts (like sets, they have no order, which
allows them to operate more efficiently; ditto). 

BUT, WE CAN CALL THE SORTED FUNCTION ON ALL FOUR OF THESE DATA STRUCTURES, and
generally on anything that is iterable: As we saw, Python executes the sorted
function by creating a temporary list from all the values produced by the
iterable, then sorts that temporary list, and then returns the sorted list.
Here is one example of how the sorted function processes votes_dict. Note that
executing sorted(votes_dict) is the same as executing sorted(votes_dict.keys())
which produces and iterates over a sorted list of the dict's keys.

<div class = "diagram">
votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20, 'Able' :  10, 'Baker' : 20, 'Dog' : 15}
for c in sorted(votes_dict):       # same as: for c in sorted(votes_dict.keys())
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', votes_dict[c], 'votes')
print(votes_dict)
</div>
It prints

<div class = "diagram">
It would show as
Candidate Able received 10 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
{'Charlie': 20, 'Able': 10, 'Baker': 20, 'Dog': 15}
</div>
-----Start alternative example
Note: if we wrote

<div class = "diagram">
votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20,  'Able' : 10,  'Baker' : 20,  'Dog' : 15}
print(sorted(votes_dict))
</div>
Python prints a list, returned by sorted, of the dictionary's keys in sorted
order:
<div class = "diagram">
['Able', 'Baker', 'Charlie', 'Dog']
</div>
-----Stop alternative example

Well, this is one "normal" way to iterate over a sorted list built from a
dictionary. We can also iterate over sorted "items" in a dictionary as follows
(the difference is in the for loop and the print). We will examine more about
dicts and the different ways to iterate over them later in this lecture. Recall
that each item in a dictionary is a 2-tuple consisting of one key and its
associated value.

<div class = "diagram">
votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20,  'Able' : 10,  'Baker' : 20,  'Dog' : 15}
for c,v in sorted(votes_dict.items()):     # note parallel/unpacking assignment
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
print(votes_dict)
</div>
It prints identically to the original example using dicts.

Notice that this print doesn't access votes[c] to get the votes: that is the
second item in each 2-tuple being iterated over using .items(). This is because
iterating over votes_dict.items() produces a sequence of 2-tuples, each
containing one key and its associated value. The order that these 2-tuples
appear in the list is unspecified, but using the sorted function ensures that
the keys appear in order.

-----Start alternative example
Note: if we wrote

<div class = "diagram">
votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20,  'Able' : 10,  'Baker' : 20,  'Dog' : 15}
print(list(votes_dict.items()))
print(sorted(votes_dict.items()))
</div>
Python first prints a list of the dictionary's items in an unspecified order,
then it prints a list of the same dictionary's items, in sorted order:

<div class = "diagram">
[('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
[('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Charlie', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
</div>
both list(...) and sorted(...) produce a list of the items in the dictionary,
with only sorted(....) producing a list that is guaranteed to be sorted.

How to use a key parameter to sort arbitrarily:

How does sort/sorted work? How do they know how to compare the values they are
sorting: where should come before which? There is a standard way to compare any
data structures, but we can also use the "key" and "reverse" parameters (which
must be used with their names, not positionally) to tell Python how to do the
sorting. The reverse parameter is simpler, so let's look at it first; writing
sorted(votes,reverse=True) sorts, but in the reverse order (writing
reverse=False is like not specifying reverse at all). So, returning to votes as
a list,

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
print(sorted(votes,reverse=True))
</div>
prints the list of 2-tuples
<div class = "diagram">
[('Dog', 15), ('Charlie', 20), ('Baker', 20), ('Able', 10)]
</div>
What sort is doing is comparing each value in the list to the others using the
standard meaning of <. You should know how Python compares str values, int
values, etc. But how does Python compare whether one tuple is less than another?
Or whether one list is less than another? The algorithm in analagous to strings,
so let's first re-examine comparing strings. The ordering, by the way, is called
"lexicographic ordering", and also "dictionary ordering" (related to the order
words appear in dictionaries that are books, not Python dicts/dictionaries).

---------------
<b>Interlude: Comparing Strings in Python:</b>

String comparison: x to y (high level: how does x compare to yl):

Find the first/minimum index i such that the ith character in x and y are
different (e.g., x[i] != y[i]). If that character in x is less than that
character in y (by the standard ASCII table) then x is less than y; if that
character in x is greater than that character in y then x is greater than y;
if there is no such different character, then how x compares to y is the same as
how  x's length compares to y's length (either less than, equal or greater
than).


Here are three examples:

<div class = "info">
  (1) How do we compare x = 'aunt' and y = 'anteater'? The first/minimum i such
  that the characters are different is 1: x[1] is 'u' and y[1] is 'n'; 'u' is
  greater than 'n', so x > y, so 'aunt' > 'anteater'.

  (2) How do we compare x = 'ant' and y = 'anteater'? There is no first/minimum
  i such that the characters are different; len(x) < len(y), so x < y, so
  'ant' < 'anteater'. The word 'ant' appears in an English dictionary before
  the word 'anteater' ('ant' is a prefix of 'anteater').

  (3) How do we compare x = 'ant' and y = 'ant'? There is no first/minimum i
  such that the characters are different; len(x) == len(y), so x == y, so
  'ant' == 'ant'. I show this example, which is trivial, just to be complete.
</div>
See the Handouts(General) webpage showing the ASCII character set, because
there are some suprises. You should memorize that the digits and lower/upper
case letters compare in order, and all digts < all upper-case letters < all
lower-case letters. So 'TINY' < 'huge' is True because the index 0 characters
different, and 'T' is < 'h' (all upper-case letters have smaller ASCII values
than any lower-case letters). Likewise, 'Aunt' < 'aunt' because 'A' < 'a'. Note
that we can always use the upper() method (as in x.upper() < y.upper()) or
lower() method to perform a comparison that ignores the case of the letters in
a string: 'TINY'.lower() > 'huge'.lower() because 'tiny' > 'huge' because
't' > 'h'.

Use these rules to determine whether '5' < '15' by comparing the string '5' to
'15'. What is your answer; what is the correct answer?
---------------

Back to comparing tuples (or lists). We basically do the same thing. We look at
what is in index 0 in the tuples; if different, then the tuples compare in the
same way as the values in index 0 compare; if the values at this index are
equal, we keep going until we find a difference, and compare the tuples the same
way that the differences compare; if there are no differences, the tuples
compare the same way their lengths compare.

So ('UCI', 100) < ('UCSD', 50) is True because at index 0 of these tuples, the
string values are different; and 'UCI' < 'UCSD' (because at index 2 of these
strings, the character values are different, and 'I' < 'S').

Whereas ('UCI', 100) < ('UCI', 200) is True because at index 0 of these tuples,
the string values are equal ('UCI' == 'UCI'), so we go to index 1, where we
find the first different values, and 100 < 200.

Finally, ('UCI', 100) < ('UCI', 100, 'extra') is True because at index 0 these
tuples the values are equal ('UCI' == 'UCI'); and at index 1 of these tuples
the values are equal (100 == 100), so there are no different values; but
the second tuple has a larger length, so it is greater than the first tuple.

Recall the sorting code from above.

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes):
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
print(votes)
</div>
The reason that the values come out in the order they do (alphabetical order)
in the code above is because the names that are in the first index in each
2-tuple are different and ensure the tuples are sorted alphabetically. Python
never gets to looking at the second value in each tuple, because the first
values (the candidate names) are always different.

Now, what if we don't want to sort by the natural tuple ordering. We can
specify a "key" function that computes a key value for every value in what is
being sorted, and the COMPUTED KEY VALUES ARE USED FOR COMPARISON, not the
original values themselves. These are the "keys" for comparison.

See the by_vote_count function below; it takes a 2-tuple argument and returns
only the second value in the tuple (recall indexes start at 0) for the key on
which Python will compare. For the argument 2-tuple ('Baker' ,20) by_vote_count
returns 20.

<div class = "diagram">
def by_vote_count(t):
    return t[1]            # remember t[0] is the first index, t[1] the second

</div>
So, when we sort with key=by_vote_count, we are telling the sorted function to
determine the order of values by calling the by_vote_count function on each
value: so in this call of sorted, we are comparing tuples based solely on their
vote part, from index 1. So writing

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=by_vote_count):
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')

</div>
produces 

<div class = "diagram">
Candidate Able received 10 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
</div>
First, notice that by writing "key=by_vote_count" Python didn't CALL the
by_vote_count function (there are no parentheses) it just passed its associated
function object to the key parameter in the sorted function. Inside the sorted
function, by_vote_count's function object automatically is called where needed,
to compare two 2-tuples, to determine in which order these values will appear in
the returned list.

Also, because Charlie and Baker both received the same number of votes, they
both appear at the bottom, but they might appear in either order; the order is
unspecified (equal values can appear in any order); here Charlie appears first.

Finally, notice that the tuples are printed in ascending order by votes;
generally for elections we want the votes to be descending, so we can combine
using key and reverse (with reverse=True) in the call to the sorted function.

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=by_vote_count, reverse=True):
    print('Candidate', c, 'received', v, 'votes')
</div>
which produces 

<div class = "diagram">
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Able received 10 votes
</div>
Again, since the top two candidates both received the same number of votes, they
could appear in any order: the order is unspecified.

Now, rather than define this simple by_vote_count function, we can use a lambda
instead, and write the following.

<div class = "diagram">
...
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=(lambda t : t[1]), reverse=True):
    ...
</div>
So, now we don't have to write/name that extra by_vote_count function. Of
course, if we did write it, we could reuse it wherever we wanted, instead of
rewriting the lambda (but the lambdas are pretty small). By writing the lambda,
the relevant code is all inside the call to sorted: we don't have to go look
elsewhere for some function defintion. So, we now know how to use functions and
lambdas in sorted.

Such a key function is used the same way when calling the sort method. If votes
is the list shown at the beginning of this section (not the dictionary above),
we can call  votes.sort(key=(lambda t : t[1]), reverse=True) to sort this list,
mutating it.

Another way to sort in reverse order (for integers) is to use the "negation"
trick illustrated below (and omit reverse=True).

<div class = "diagram">
...
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=(lambda t : -t[1]) ):
    ...
</div>
Here we have negated the vote count part of the tuple, and removed reverse=True.
So it is sorting from smallest to largest, but the key function returns the
negative of the vote values (because that is what the lambda says to do). It is
comparing -20, -10, -20, and -15 to sort. So here the biggest vote count
corresponds to the smallest negative number (so the tuple with that number will
appear first). The tuples appear in the order specified by the key functions:
-20, -20, -15, -10 (smallest to largest). These negative values returned by the
key function are used only to determine the order insides sorted; they do not
appear in the results.

Finally, typically when multiple candidates are tied for votes, we want to print
their names together (because they all have the same number of votes) but also
in alphabetical order. We do this in Python by specifying a key function that
returns a tuple in which the vote count is checked first and sorted in
descending order; and only if the votes are equal will the names be checked and
sorted in ascending order. Because we want the tuples in decreasing vote
counts but increasing names, we cannot just use reverse=True: it would reverse
both the vote AND name comparisons; we need to resort to the "negation trick"
above and write

<div class = "diagram">
votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=(lambda t : (-t[1],t[0])) ):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
</div>
So it compares the 2-tuple keys (-20, 'Charlie'), (-10, 'Able'), (-20, 'Baker'),
and (-15, 'Dog') when ordering the actual 2-tuples, and by what we have learned

(-20, 'Baker') < (-20, 'Charlie') < (-15, 'Dog') < (-10, 'Able')

which produces 

<div class = "diagram">
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Able received 10 votes
</div>
So with this key function, the previous order is GUARANTEED, even though Baker
and Charlie both received the same number (20) of votes, 'Baker' < 'Charlie' so
that 2-tuple will appear first.

Finally, note that the lambda in the key ensures Python compares ('Charlie', 20)
and ('Dog', 15) as if they were (-20, 'Charlie') and (-15, 'Dog'), so the first
tuple will be less (and appear earlier) in the sorted list (the one with the
highest votes has the lowest negative votes). And when Python compares
('Charlie', 20) and ('Baker' ,20) as if they were (-20, 'Charlie') and
(-20, 'Baker') so the second tuple will be less and the tuple it was produced
from will appear earlier (equal votes and then 'Baker' < 'Charlie').

So think of sorting

<div class = "diagram">

('Charlie', 20)   ('Able', 10)   ('Baker' ,20)   ('Dog', 15)
       |                |               |              |  using the key function
       |                |               |              |  it really compares
       V                V               V              V  
(-20, 'Charlie')  (-10, 'Able')  (-20, 'Baker')  (-15, 'Dog')

which sorts to 

(-20,'Baker')     (-20,'Charlie')   (-15,'Dog')    (-10,'Able')
       |                |               |              | actual values in list
       |                |               |              | (without key function)
       V                V               V              V
('Baker',20)      ('Charlie', 20)   ('Dog',15)     ('Able', 10)

</div>
so the order of the actual list returned by sorted is

<div class = "diagram">

[('Baker', 20), ('Charlie', 20), ('Dog', 15),  ('Able', 10)]

</div>
which is sorted by decreasing vote, with equal votes sorted alphabetically
increasing by name.

Our ability to use this "negation trick" works in SOME cases, but unfortunately
NOT IN ALL cases: we can sort arbitarily using this trick exactly when "all non-
numerical data is sorted in the same way" (all increasing or all decreasing). In
such cases, we can negate any numerical data, if we need to sort it decreasing.
So, we can sort the above example because we are sorting only one non-numerical
datum. By the requirement, all non-numerical data (there is only one on this
example, the name) is sorted the same way (increasing).

Using the "negation trick" is therefore not generalizable to all sorting tasks:
for example, if we had a list of 2-tuples containing strings of candidates and
strings of the states they are running in

<div class = "diagram">

  [('Charlie', 'CA'), ('Able', 'NY'), ('Baker' ,'CA'), ('Dog', 'IL')]

</div>

there is no way to use the "negation trick" to sort them primarily by
decreasing state, and secondarily by increasing name (when two candidates come
from the same state). Here it is not the case that "all non-numerical data is
sorted the same way": each string data is sorted differently. In this case the
sorted list would be

<div class = "diagram">

  [('Able', 'NY'), ('Dog', 'IL'), ('Charlie', 'CA'), ('Baker' ,'CA')]
</div>

even though we wanted it to be (note the last two names, from the same state)
<div class = "diagram">

  [('Able', 'NY'), ('Dog', 'IL'), ('Baker', 'CA'), ('Charlie' ,'CA')]
</div>

We cannot apply the "negation trick" to either of the strings: we cannot negate
strings at all. But we can produce a list in this specified order by calling
sorted multiple times, as is illustrated below. 

---------------
<b>Arbitrary sorting: multiple calls to sorted with "stable" sorting</b>

Python's sorted function (and sort method) are "stable". This property means
that "equal" values (decided naturally, or with the key function supplied) keep
their same "relative" order (left-to-right positions) in the data being sorted.

For example, assume that db is a list of 2-tuples, each specifying a student:
index 0 is a student's name; index 1 is that student's grade.

<div class = "diagram">

  db = [('Bob','A'),    ('Mary','C'), ('Pat','B'), ('Fred','B'), ('Gail','A'),
        ('Irving','C'), ('Betty','B'), ('Rich','F')]
</div>

If we call
<div class = "diagram">
  sorted(db, key = lambda x : x[1])   # sorted by index 1 only: their grade
</div>

Python returns the following list, whose 2-tuples are sorted by grade. Because
sorting is "stable", all 2-tuples with the same grade (equal values by the key
function) keep their same relative order (left-to-right positions) in the list.

<div class = "diagram">

  [('Bob','A'),  ('Gail','A'),   ('Pat','B'), ('Fred','B'), ('Betty','B'),
   ('Mary','C'), ('Irving','C'), ('Rich','F')]
</div>

Notice that...

<div class = "info">

  (1) in the original list, the students with 'A' grades are 'Bob' and 'Gail',
      with 'Bob' to the left of 'Gail'. In the returned list, 'Bob' is also to
      the left of 'Gail'. 

  (2) in the original list, the students with 'B' grades are 'Pat', 'Fred', and
      'Betty', with 'Pat' to the left of 'Fred' and 'Fred' to the left of
      'Betty'. In the returned list, 'Pat' is to the left of 'Fred' and 'Fred'
      is to the left of 'Betty'.

  (3) in the original list, the students with 'C' grades are 'Mary' and
      'Irving', with 'Mary' to the left of 'Irving'. In the returned list,
      'Mary' is also to the left of 'Irving'. 

  (4) there is only one student with an 'F' grade.
</div>

Now, suppose that we wanted to sort this list so that primarily the 2-tuples
are sorted DECREASING by grade ('F's, then 'D's, then 'C's, then 'B's, then
'A's); and for students who have equal grades, the 2-tuples are sorted
INCREASING alphabetically by student name. We can accomplish this task by
calling sorted twice, by writing
<div class = "diagram">

  sorted( sorted(db, key=(lambda x : x[0])), key=(lambda x : x[1]), reverse=True )
</div>

The inner call to sorted produces the list
<div class = "diagram">

  [('Betty','B'), ('Bob','A'), ('Fred','B'), ('Gail','A'), ('Irving','C'),
   ('Mary','C'),  ('Pat','B'), ('Rich','F')]
</div>

which is sorted INCREASING by the student's name: all names are distinct
(different), so stability is irrelevant here.

The outer call to sorted, using the "sorted by name" db list as an argument,
produces the list
<div class = "diagram">

  [('Rich','F'), ('Irving','C'), ('Mary','C'), ('Betty','B'), ('Fred','B'),
   ('Pat','B'),  ('Bob','A'),    ('Gail','A')]

</div>
which is sorted DECREASING by the student's grade: for equal grades, the
stability property ensures that all names are still sorted INCREASING by the
student's name (because the argument is sorted that way). Here, the 'B' students
are in the alphabetical order 'Betty', 'Fred', and 'Pat'. Note that we could
simplify this code to just

<div class = "diagram">
  sorted( sorted(db), key=(lambda x : x[1]), reverse = True )
</div>
because for the inner call to sorted, no key function is the same as the key
function that specifies sorting the 2-tuples in the natural way (alphabetically
by name). We could use a temporary variable and write this code as

<div class = "diagram">
  temp = sorted(db)
  sorted( temp, key = lambda x : x[1], reverse = True )
</div>
Thus, we can sort complex structures in any arbitrary way (some data increasing,
some data decreasing) by calling sorted multiple times on it. The LAST call will
dictate the primary order in which it is sorted; each preceding/inner call
dictates how the data is sorted if values specified by the outer orders are
equal.

Experiment with these various forms of sorting, using reverse, keys, the 
negation trick, and multiple calls to sort.
---------------

Finally, to solve the original problem above (with candidates and their states:
also involving two strings sorted primarily DECREASING on state and INCREASING
on name)

<div class = "diagram">
  db  = [('Charlie', 'CA'), ('Able', 'NY'), ('Baker' ,'CA'), ('Dog', 'IL')]
</div>

we would call 

<div class = "diagram">

  sorted( sorted(db), key=(lambda x : x[1]), reverse = True )

</div>
Bottom line on sorting:

  To achieve our sorting goal, if we can call sorted once, using a complicated
  key (possibly involving the "negation trick") and reverse, that is the
  preferred approach: it is shortest/clearest in code and fastest in computer
  time. But if we are unable to specify a single key function and reverse that
  do the job, we can always call sorted multiple times, using multiple key
  functions and multiple reverses, sometimes relying on the "stability"
  property to achieve our sorting goal.

We now have a general tool bag for sorting all types of information. Sorting
will be heavily tested in Quiz #1, Programming Assignment #1, and In-Lab #1.

<div id = "print">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The print function</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Notice how the sep and end parameters in print help control how the printed
values are separated and what is printed after the last one. Recall that print
can have any number of arguments (we will see how this is done in Python soon),
and it prints the str(...) of each parameter. By default, sep=' ' (space) and
end='\n' (newline). So the following

<div class = "diagram">
print(1,2,3,4,sep='--',end='/')
print(5,6,7,8,sep='x',end='**')
</div>
prints

<div class = "diagram">
1--2--3--4/5x6x7x8**
</div>
Also recall that all functions must return a value. The print function returns
the value None: this function serves as a statement: it has an "effect" (of
displaying information in the console window; we might say changing the state
of the console) but returns no useful "value"; but all functions must return a
value, so this one returns None. Recall that the sort method on lists mutated
a list (its primarly action) but also had to return a value, so returned None.

Sometimes we use sep='' to control spaces more finely. In this case we must put
in all the spaces ourselves. If we want to separate only 2 and 3 by a space,
we write

<div class = "diagram">
print(1,2,' ',3,sep='')
</div>
which prints

<div class = "diagram">
12 3
</div>
Still, other times we can concatenate values together into one string (which
requires us to explicitly use the str function on the things we want to print).

<div class = "diagram">
x = 10
print('Your answer of '+str(x)+' is too high.'+'\nThis is on the next line')
</div>
Note the use of the "escape" sequence \n to generate a new line. It doesn't
print a '\' followed by an 'n'; Python interprets '\n' to be the newline
character: the remaining output starts at the beginning of the next line.

Finally, we can also use the very general-purpose .format function. This
function is illustrated in Section 6.1.3 in the documentation of The Python
Standard Library. The following two statements print equivalently: for a string
with many format substitutions, I prefer the form with a name (here x) in the
braces of the string and as a named parameter in the arguments to format.

<div class = "diagram">
print('Your answer of {} is too high\nThis is on the next line'.format(10))

print('Your answer of {x} is too high\nThis is on the next line'.format(x=10))
</div>
In Python 3.6 and beyond we can use f-strings (formatted strings; google PEP
498) to solve this problem even more simply.

<div class = "diagram">
print(f'Your answer of {x} is too high\nThis is on the next line')
</div>
Here, any expression in {} is evaluated and turned into a string embedded
in the f-string. We could write {x+1} or any other expression instead of just
the x in the {}.

<div id = "slicing">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">String/List/Tuple (SLT) slicing:</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
SLTs represent sequences of indexable values, whose indexes start at index 0,
and go up to -but do not include- the length of the SLT (which we can compute
using the len function).

<div class = "info">
1) Indexing: We can index a SLT by writing SLT[i], where i is in the range 0
  to len(SLT)-1 inclusive, or i is negative and i is in the range
  -len(SLT) to -1 inclusive: if an index is not in these ranges, Python raises
  an exception. Note SLT[0] is the value store in the first index, SLT[-1] is
  the value stored in the last index, SLT[-2] is the value stored in the 2nd
  to last index.

2) Slicing: We can specify a slice by SLT[i:j] which includes SLT[i] followed
   by SLT[i+1], ... SLT[j-1]. Slicing a string produces another string,
   slicing a list produces another list, and slicing a tuple produces another
   tuple). The resulting structures has j-i elements if indexes i through j are
   in the SLT (or 0 if j-i is <= 0); for this formula, both indexes must be
   non-negative or both positive; if they are different, convert the negative
   to it non-negative (or the non-negative to its negative) equivalent.

   If the slice contain no values it is empty (an  empty string, an empty list,
    and empty tuple).
  
   If the first index come before index 0, then index 0 is used; if the second
   index comes after the biggest index, then index len(SLT) is used. Finally,
   if the first index is omitted it is 0; if the second index is omitted it is
   len(SLT).

   Here are some examples
<div class = "diagram">
s = 'abcde'
x = s[1:3]
print (x)     # prints 'bc' which is 3-1 = 2 values
x = s[-4:-1]
print (x)     # prints 'bcd' same as s[1:4] which is 4-1 = 3 values
x = s[1:-2]
print (x)     # prints 'bc' same as s[1:3] which is 3-1 = 2
x = s[-4:-2]
print (x)     # prints 'bc' same as s[1:3] which is 3-1 = 2 values
x = s[1:10]
print (x)     # prints 'bcde' which is len(x)-1 = 4 values
</div>
   likewise
<div class = "diagram">
s = ('a','b','c','d','e')
x = s[1:3]
print (x)     # prints ('b','c') which is 3-1 = 2 values
x = s[-4:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('b','c','d') which is -1-(-4) = 3 values

   s[:i] is index 0 up to but not including i (can be positive or negative)
   s[i:] is index i up to and including the last index; so s[-2:] is the last
         two values.
</div>
3) Slicing with a stride: We can specify a slice by SLT[i:j:k] which includes
   SLT[i] followed by SLT[i+k], SLT[i+2k] ... SLT[j-1]. This follows the rules
   for slicing too, and allows negative numbers for indexing.

<div class = "diagram">
s = ('a','b','c','d','e')
x = s[::2]
print (x)     # prints ('a','c','e')
x = s[1::2]
print (x)     # prints ('b','d')

x = s[3:1:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('d','c')
x = s[-1:1:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('e','d','c')
</div>
</div>
  When the stride is omitted, it is +1. If the stride is negative, if the first
  index is omitted it is len(SLT); if the last index is omitted it is -1.
  Compare these to the values if omitted above in part 2, which assumed a
  positive stride.

Experiment with various slices of strings (the easiest to write) to verify you
understand what results they produce.

<div id = "condition">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Conditional statement vs. Conditional expression:</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python has an if/else STATEMENT, which is a conditional statement. It also has a
conditional EXPRESSION that uses the same keywords (if and else), which while
not as generally useful, sometimes is exactly the right tool to simplify a
programming task.

A conditional statement uses a boolean expression to decide which indented
block of statements to execute; a conditional expression uses a boolean
expression to decide which one of exactly two other expressions to evaluate:
the value of the evaluated expression is the value of the conditional
expression.

The form of a conditional expression is
<div class = "diagram">

  resultT if test else resultF
</div>

This says, the expression evaluates to the value of resultT if test is True
and the value of resultF if test is False; first it evaluates test, and then
evaluates either resultT or resultF (but only one, not the other) as necessary.
Like other short-circuit operators in Python (do you know which?) it evaluates
only the subexpressions it needs to determine the result.

I often write conditional expresions inside parentheses for clarity (as I did
for lambdas; sometimes the parentheses are required, as with lambdas). See the
examples below.

Here is a simple example. We start with a conditional statement, which always
stores a value into min: either x or y depending on whether x <= y. Note that
regardless of the test, min is bound to some value.

<div class = "diagram">
  if x <= y:
      min = x
  else:
      min = y
</div>
We can write this using a simpler conditional expression, capturing the fact
that we are always storing into min, and just deciding which value to store in
it.

<div class = "diagram">
  min = (x if x <= y else y)
</div>
Not all conditional statements can be converted into conditional expressions;
typically only simple ones can: ones with a single statement in their indented
blocks. But using conditional expressions in these cases simplifies the code
even more. So attempt to use conditional expression, but use good judgement
after you see what the code looks like. Write the simplest looking code.

Here is another example; it always prints x followed by some message

<div class = "diagram">
  if x % 2 == 0:
      print(x,'is even')
  else:
      print(x,'is odd')
</div>
We can rewrite it as as calling print with a conditional expression inside
deciding what string to print at the end.

<div class = "diagram">
      print(x, ('is even' if x%2 == 0 else 'is odd'))
</div>
We can also write it as a one argument print using concatenation:
<div class = "diagram">
      print(str(x) + ' is ' + ('even' if x%2 == 0 else 'odd'))
</div>
Note that conditional expressions REQUIRE using BOTH THE if AND else KEYWORDS,
along with the test boolean expression and the two expressions needed in the
cases where the test is True or the test is False. Some conditional statements
use just if (and no else nor elif).

As an example of f-strings, we can write this as
<div class = "diagram">
      print(f"{x} is {'even' if x%2 == 0 else 'odd'}")
</div>
because we can write a conditional EXPRESSION inside {}, because we can put
any expression there. Note I had to write the outside string using " to specify
'even' and 'odd' as strings in the f-string.

</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "else">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The else: block-else option in for/while loops</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
For and while looping statements are described as follows. The else: block-else
is optional, and not often used. But we will explore its meaning here.

<div class = "diagram">

for_statement   <= for index(es) in iterable:
                       block-body
                   [else:
                       block-else]

while_statement <= while (bool-expression):
                       block-body
                   [else:
                       block-else]
</div>

Here are the semantics of else: block-else.
<div class = "warning">

   If the else: block-else option appears, and the loop terminated normally,
   (not with a break statement) then execute block-else.
</div>

Here is an example that makes good use of the else: block-else option. This
code prints the first/lowest value (looking at the values 0 to 100 inclusive)
for which the function special_property returns True (and then breaks out of
the loop); otherwise it prints that no value in this range had this property:
so it prints exactly one of these two messages. Note you cannot run this code,
because there is no special_property function: I'm using it for illustration
only.

<div class = "diagram">
for i in irange(100):
    if special_property(i):
        print(i,'is the first value with the special property')
        break
else:
    print('No value in the range had the special property')
</div>
Without the else: block-else option, the simplest code that I can write that has
equivalent meaning is as follows.

<div class = "diagram">
found_one = False
for i in irange(100):
    if special_property(i):
        print(i,'is the first with the special property')
        found_one = True
        break
if not found_one:
    print('No value in the range had the special property')
</div>
This solution requires an extra name (found_one), an assignment to set and
reset the name, and an if statement. Although I came up with the example above,
I have not used the else: block-else option much in Python. Most programming
languages that I have used don't have this special feature, so I'm still
exploring its usefulness. Every so often I have found an elegant use of this
construct. 

Can you predict what would happen if I removed the break statement in the
bigger code above? Run the code to check your answer.

<div id = "matching">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Argument/Parameter Matching (leaves out **kargs, discussed later)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Recall that when functions are called, Python first evaluates the arguments,
then matches/binds them with parameters, and finally executes the body of the
function using the names of parameters (bound to the values of arguments).

Let's explore the argument/parameter matching rules. First we classify
arguments and parameters, according to the options that they include. Remember
that arguments appear in function CALLS and parameters appear in function
HEADERS (the first line in a function defintion).

<div class = "info">
Arguments
  positional argument: an argument NOT preceded by the name= option
  named      argument: an argument preceded by the name= option

Parameters
  name-only parameter       :a parameter not followed by =default argument value
  default-argument parameter:a parameter followed by =default argument value
</div>
When Python calls a function, it must define every parameter name in the
function's header (binding each to the argument value object matching that
parameter's name, just like an assignment statement). In the rules below, we
will learn exactly how Python matches arguments to parameters according to
three criteria: positions, parameter names, and default arguments for parameter
names. We will also learn how to write functions that can receive an arbitrary
number of arguments (so, for example, we can write our own print function).

Here is a concise statement of Python's rules for matching arguments to
parameters. The rules are applied in this order (e.g., once you reach M3 we
cannot go back to M1).

<div class = "info">

M1. Match positional argument values in the call sequentially to the
    parameters named in the header's corresponding positions (both name-only
    and default-argument parameters are OK to match). Stop when reaching any
    named argument in the call, or the * parameter (if any) in the header.

M2. If matching a * parameter in the header, match all remaining positional
    argument values to it. Python creates a tuple that stores all these
    arguments. The parameter name (typically args) is bound to this tuple.

M3. Match named-argument values in the call to their like-named parameters
    in the header (both name-only and default-argument parameters are OK).

M4. Match any remaining default-argument parameters in the header (unmatched
    by rules M1 and M3) with their specified default argument values.

M5. Exceptions: If at any time (a) an argument cannot match a parameter
    (e.g., a positional-argument follows a named-argument) or (b) a parameter
    is matched multiple times by arguments; or if at the end of the process
    (c) any parameter has not been matched or (d) if a named-argument does not
    match the name of a parameter, raise an exception: SyntaxError for (a) and
    TypeError for (b), (c), and (d). These exceptions report that the function
    call does not correctly match its header by these rules.
</div>
[When we examine a **kargs as a parameter, we will learn what Python does when
there are extra named arguments in a function call: names besides those of
parameters: preview: it puts all remaing named arguments in a dictionary, with
their name as the key and their value associated with that key). The parameter
name (typically kargs or kwargs) is bound to this dictionary.]

When this argument-parameter matching process if finished, Python defines,
(in the function's namespace), a name for every parameter and binds each to
the unique argument it matched using the above rules. Passing parameters is
similar to performing a series of assignment statements between parameter names
and their matching argument values.

If a function call raises no exception, these rules ensure that each parameter
in the function header matches the value of exactly one argument in the
function call. After Python binds each parameter name to its argument, it
executes the body of the function, which computes and returns the result of
calling the function.

Here are some examples of functions that we can call to explore the rules for
argument/parameter matching specified above. These functions just print their
parameters, so we can see the arguments bound to them (or see which exception
they raise). Certainly you should try others to increase your understanding.

</div>
Here is a real but simple example of using *args, showing how the max function
is implememented in Python; we dont' really need to write this function because
it is in Python already, but here is how it is written in Python. We will cover
raising exceptions later in this lecture note, so don't worry about that code.

<div class = "diagram">
def max(*args) :         # Can refer to args inside; it is a tuple of values
    if len(args) == 0:
        raise TypeError('max: expected >=1 arguments, got 0')

    answer = None
    for i in args:
        if answer == None or i > answer:
            answer = i
    return answer

print(max(3,-4, 2, 8)) # max with many arguments; prints 8
</div>
In fact, the real max function in Python can take either (a) any number of
arguments or (b) one iterable argument. It is a bit more subtle to write
correctly to handle both parameter structures, but here is the code.

<div class = "diagram">
def max(*args) :         # Can refer to args inside; it is a tuple of values
    if len(args) == 0:
        raise TypeError('max: expected >=1 arguments, got 0')

    if len(args) == 1:     # Assume that if max has just one argument then
        args = args[0]     #   it's iterable, so take the max over its values

    answer = None
    for i in args:
        if answer == None or i > answer:
            answer = i
    return answer

l = (3,-4, 2, 8)
print(max(l))          # max with one iterable argument; prints 8
</div>
Finally, because of this approach computing max(3) raises an exception, because
Python expects a single argument to be iterable. It might be reasonable in this
case to return 3, but that is not the semantics (meaning) of the max function
built into Python.

Here is another real example of using *args, where I show how the print function
is written in Python. The myprint calls a very simple version of print, just
once at the end, to print only one string that it builds from args along with
sep and end; it prints the same thing the normal print would print with the same
arguments. Notice the use of the conditional if in the first line, to
initialize s to either '' or the string value of the first argument.

<div class = "diagram">
def myprint(*args, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    s = (str(args[0]) if len(args) >= 1 else '') # handle 1st (if there) special
    for a in args[1:]:                   # all others come after sep
        s += sep + str(a)
    s += end           # end at the end
    print(s,end='')        # print the entire string s

myprint('a',1,'x')       # prints a line
myprint('a',1,'x',sep='*',end='E') # prints a line but stays at end
myprint('a',1,'x')       # continues at end of previous line
</div>
Together when executed, these print
<div class = "diagram">
a 1 x
a*1*xEa 1 x
</div>
This is what would be printed if the print (not myprint) function was called.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Constructors operating on Iterable values to Construct Data</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">

<b>List, Tuples, Sets:</b>

Python's "for" loops allow us to iterate through all the components of any
iterable data. We can even iterate through strings: iterating over their
individual characters. Later in the quarter, we will study iterator protocols
in detail, both the special iter/__iter__ and next/__next__ methods in classes,
and generators (which are very very similar to functions, with a small but
powerful twist). Both will improve our understanding of iterators and also
allow us to write our own iterable data types (classes) easily. 

Certainly we know about using "for" loops and iterable data (as illustrated by
lots of code above). What I want to illustrate here is how easy it is to
create lists, tuples, and sets from anything that is iterable by using the
list, tuple, and set constructors (we'll deal with dict constructors later in
this section). For example, in each of the following the constructor for the
list/tuple/set objects iterates over the string argument to get the 1-char
strings that become the values in the list/tuple/set object.

<div class = "diagram">
l = list ('radar') then l is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']
t = tuple('radar') then t is ('r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r')
s = set  ('radar') then s is {'a', 'r', 'd'} or {'d', 'r', 'a'} or ...
</div>
Note that lists/tuples are ORDERED, so whatever the iteration order of their
iterator argument is, the values in the list/tuple will be the same order.
Contrast this with sets, which have (no duplicates and) no special order. So,
set('radar') can print its three different values in any order.

Likewise, since tuples/sets are iterable, we can also compute a list from a
list, a list from a a tuple, or a list from a set. Using l, t, and s from above.

<div class = "diagram">
list(t) which is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']
list(s) which is ['r', 'd', 'a']  assuming s iterates in the order 'r', 'd', 'a'
list(l) which is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']
</div>
The last of these iterates over the list to create a new list with the same
values: note that l is list(l) is False, but l == list(l) is True: there are
two different lists, but they store the same contents (see the next section on
"is" vs "==" for more details).

Likewise we could create a tuple from a list/set, or a set from a list/tuple.
All the constructors handle iterable data, producing a result of the specified
type by iterating over their argument. 

Note that students sometimes try to use a list constructor to create a list with
one value. They write list(1), by Python responds with "TypeError: 'int' object
is not iterable" because the list constructor is expecting an iterable argument.
The correct way to specify this list with one value is [1]. Likewise for tuples,
sets, and dictionaries.

Program #1 will give you lots of experience with these data types and when and
how to use them. The take-away now is it is trivial to convert from one of these
data types to another, because the constructors for their classes all allow
iterable values as their arguments, and all these data types (and strings as
well) are iterable (can be iterated over).


<b>Dictionary Constructors:</b>

Before leaving this topic, we need to look at how dictionaries fit into the 
notion of iterable. There is not just ONE way to iterate through dictionaries,
but there are actually THREE ways to iterate through dictionaries: by keys, by
values, and by items (each item a 2-tuple with a key folowed by its associated
value).  Each of these is summoned by a method name for dict, and the methods
are named the same: keys, values, and items.

So if we write the following to bind d to a dict (we will discuss this "magic"
constructor soon)

<div class = "diagram">
d = dict(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5) # the same as d = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4,'e':5}
</div>
Then we can create lists of three aspects of the dict:
<div class = "diagram">
list(d.keys  ()) is like ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd']
list(d.values()) is like [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
list(d.items ()) is like [('c', 3), ('b', 2), ('a', 1), ('e', 5), ('d', 4)]
</div>
I said "is like" because sets and dicts are NOT ORDERED: in the first case we
get a list of the keys; in the second a list of the values; in the third a list
of item tuples, where each tuple contains one key and its associated value. But
in all three cases, the list's values can appear in ANY ORDER.

Note that the keys in a dict are always unique, but there might be duplicates
among the values: try the code above with d = dict(a=1,b=2,c=1). Items are
unique because they contain keys (which are unique).

Also note that if we iterate over a dict without specifying how, it is
equivalent to specifyihg d.keys(). That is

<div class = "diagram">
list(d) is the same as list(d.keys()) which is like ['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'd']
</div>
One way to construct a dict is to give it an iterable, where each value
is either a 2-tuple or 2-list: a key followed by its associated value. So, we
could have written any of the following to initialize d:

<div class = "diagram">
d = dict( [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3], ['d', 4], ['e', 5]] ) #list of  2-list
d = dict( [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)] ) #list of  2-tuple
d = dict( (['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3], ['d', 4], ['e', 5]) ) #tuple of 2-list
d = dict( (('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)) ) #tuple of 2-tuple
</div>
or, even (a tuple that has a mixture of 2-tuples and 2-lists in it)
<div class = "diagram">
d = dict( (('a', 1), ['b', 2], ('c', 3), ['d', 4], ('e', 5)) )
</div>
or even (a set of 2-tuples; we cannot have a set of 2-list (see hashable below)
<div class = "diagram">
d = dict( {('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)} )
</div>
The bottom line is that a positional dict argument must be iterable, and each
value in the iterable must have 2 values (e.g., a 2-list or 2-tuple) that
represent a key followed by its associated value.

We can also combine the two forms writing 
<div class = "diagram">
d = dict( {('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)}, f=6, g=7)
</div>
Finally, if we wanted to construct a dict using the keys/values in another
dict, here are two easy ways to do it
<div class = "diagram">
d_copy = dict(d)

or

d_copy = dict(d.items())
</div>
In both cases the dict constructor creates a new dictionary by iterating through
the (key,value) 2-tuples.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "sharing">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sharing/Copying:  is vs. ==</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
It is important to understand the fundamental difference between two names
sharing an object (bound to the same object) and two names referring/bound to
"copies of the same object". Note that if we mutate a shared object, both names
"see" the change: both are bound to the same object which has mutated. But if
they refer to different copies of an object, only one name "sees" the change.

Note the difference between the Python operators is and ==. Both return boolean
values. The first asks whether two references/binding are to the same object
(the is operator is called the (object)identity operator); the second asks only
whether the two objects store the same values. See the different results
produced for the example below. Also note that if x is y is True, then x == y
must be True too: an object ALWAY stores the same values as itself. But if
x == y is True, x is y may or may not be True.

For example, compare execution of the following scripts: the only difference
is the second statement in each: y = x vs. y = list(x)

<div class = "diagram">
x = ['a']
y = x   # Critical: y and x share the same reference
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
x [0] = 'z' # Mutate x (could also append something to it)
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
</div>
This prints
<div class = "diagram">
x: ['a'] y: ['a'] x is y: True x == y: True
x: ['z'] y: ['z'] x is y: True x == y: True
</div>

<div class = "diagram">
x = ['a']
y = list(x) # Critical: y refers to a new list with the same contents as x
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
x [0] = 'z' # Mutate x (could also append something to it: x+)
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
</div>
This prints
<div class = "diagram">
x: ['a'] y: ['a'] x is y: False x == y: True
x: ['z'] y: ['a'] x is y: False x == y: False
</div>
You might have learned about the id function: it returns a unique integer for
any object. It is often implemented to return the first address in memory at
which an object is stored, but there is no requirement that it returns this int.
Checking "a is b" is equivalent to checking "id(a) == id(b)" but the first way
to do this check (with the is operator) is preferred (and is faster).

Finally there is a copy module in Python that defines a copy function: it
copies some iterable without us having to specify the specific constructor
(like list, set, tuple, or dict).

So we can import it as: from copy import copy

Assuming x is a list, we can replace y = list(x) by y = copy(x).
Likewise, if x is a dict we can replace y = dict(x) by y = copy(x).

We could also just: import copy (the module) and then write y = copy.copy(x)
but it is clearer in this case to write "from copy import copy". Here is a
simple implementation of copy:

<div class = "diagram">
def copy(x):
    return type(x)(x)
</div>
which finds the type of x, then calls it as a constructor to construct a new
object of that type, intialized by x: iterating over all the values in x, as
we say in examples list list('abc') producing ['a', 'b', 'c'].

----------

Note that copying in all the ways that we have discussed is SHALLOW. That means
the "copy" is a new object, but that object stores all the references from the
"object being copied". For example, if we write

<div class = "diagram">
  x = [1, [2]]
  y = list(x) # or y = copy(x) or y = x[:]
</div>
then we would draw the following picture for these assignments.

<div class = "diagram">
                list              list
            (-----------)      (-------)        
  x         |   0   1   |      |   0   |        int
+---+       | +---+---+ |      | +---+ |       (---)
| --+------>| | | | --+-+----->| | --+-+-----> | 2 |
+---+       | +-+-+---+ |      | +---+ |       (---)
            (---+-------)      (-------)
                |                  ^
                v                  |
               int                 |
              (---)                |
              | 1 |<--------+      |
              (---)         |      |
                            |      |
                list        |      |
            (-----------)   |      |
  y         |   0   1   |   |      |
+---+       | +---+---+ |   |      |
| --+------>| | | | --+-+---+------+
+---+       | +-+-+---+ |   |
            (---+-------)   |
                |           |
                +-----------+
</div>
Here, x and y refer to DIFFERENT lists: but all the references in x's list are
identical to the references in y's list. Using the 'is" operator we can state
that (1) x[0] is y[0] == True, and (2) x[1] is y[1] == True.

This means if we now write x[1][0] = 'a', then print(y[1][0]) prints 'a' too,
because x[1] and y[1] refer to the same list.

We will discuss how to do DEEP copying when we discuss recursion later in the
course; it is implemented in the copy module by the function named deepcopy,
which does a deep copy of an object, by constucting an object of that type and
populating it with deep copies of all the objects in the original object.

But, if we wrote
<div class = "diagram">
  from copy import deepcopy
  x = [1, [2]]
  y = deepcopy(x)
</div>
then we would draw the following picture for these assignments.

<div class = "diagram">
                list              list
            (-----------)      (-------)        
  x         |   0   1   |      |   0   |       int
+---+       | +---+---+ |      | +---+ |       (---)
| --+------>| | | | --+-+----->| | --+-+-----> | 2 |
+---+       | +-+-+---+ |      | +---+ |       (---)
            (---+-------)      (-------)         ^
                |                                |
                v                                |
               int                               |
              (---)                              |
              | 1 |<--------+                    |
              (---)         |                    |
                            |                    |
                list        |      list          |

                +-----------+
</div>
In a deep copy, all the mutable objects referred to are copied, but the
immutable ones referred to are not copied.

For more information on mutable, see the next section.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "hashable">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hashable vs. Mutable and how to Change Things:</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python uses the term Hashable, which has the same meaning as Immutable. So
hashable and mutable are OPPOSITES: You might see this message relating to
errors when using sets with UNHASHABLE values or dicts with UNHASHABLE keys:
since hashable means immutable, then un-hashable means un-immutable which
simplifies (the two negatives cancel) to mutable. So unhashable means the same
as mutable. So

<div class = "warning">
hashable    means the same as immutable
unhashalble means the same as mutable
</div>
Here is a quick breakdown of standard Python types

<div class = "info">

Hashable/immutable: numeric values, strings, tuples containing
                      hashable/immutable data, frozenset
mutable/unhashable: list, sets, dict
</div>
The major difference between tuples and lists in Python is the former is
(mostly) hashable/immutable and the later is not. I say mostly because if a
tuple contains mutable data, you can mutate the mutable data part. So
<div class = "diagram">
  x = (1, 2, [3, 4])
  x[2][0] = 'a'
  print(x)
</div>
prints 
<div class = "diagram">
  (1, 2, ['a', 4])
</div>
So you have mutated the tuple because you mutated the list stored in index 2
of the tuple. On the other hand, you cannot append to a tuple, nor store a new
value in one of its indexes (x[0] = 10 is not allowed).

So technically, a tuple storing hashable/immutable values is hashable/immutable,
but a tuple storing unhashable/mutable values is unhashable/mutable. So if some
other datatype (e.g., values in a set, or keys in a dictionary) needs to be
hashable/immutable, use a tuple (storing hashable/immutable values) to
represent its value, not a list. Thus we cannot say, "Any value whose type is a
tuple is hashable/immutable." Instead we must say, "A value whose type is a
tuple is hashability/immutability when the tuple stores only hashable/immutable
values."

A frozenset can do everything that a set can do, but doesn't allow any mutator
methods to be called (so we cannot add a value to or delete a value from a
frozenset). Thus, we can use a frozen set as a value in a set or a key in a
dictionary.

The constructor for a frozenset is frozenset(...) not {}. Note that once you've
constructed a frozen set you cannot change it (because it is immutable). If you
have a set s and need an equivalent frozenset, just write frozenset(s).

The function hash takes an argument that is hashable (otherwise it raises
TypeError, with a message about a value from an unhashable type) and returns
an int.

We will study hashing towards the end of the quarter: it is a technique for
allowing very efficient operations on sets and dicts. ICS-46 (Data Structures)
studies hash tables in much more depth, in which you will implement the
equivalent of Python sets and dicts by using hash tables.

------
<b>Interlude: unique objects</b>

Small integer objects are unique in Python. If we assign x = 1 and y = 1, then
x is y evaluates to True (but you should use == and != for comparing integers).
Likewise, if we write x += 1 and y *= 2 then x is y evaluates to True. But if we
write x = 10**100 and y = 10**100. then x is y is False (but x == y is True, as
expected).

To save space, Python allocates only one object for each small int. When a small
int is computed, Python first looks to see if an object with that value already
exists, and if it does, returns a reference to it; if it doesn't, it makes a new
object storing that values and returns a reference to it. This is a tradeoff
that minimizes the space (occupied by objects) but increases the time to do
computations (by having to first look to see if an object for a value already
exists).

Generally, because ints are immutable, there are no bad consequences in sharing
objects in this way: once a name is bound to an int object, that int object
will always represent the same value, because ints are immutable.

Again, constrast this with writing lists, which always allocate new objects. If
we write 

<div class = "diagram">
x = ['a']
y = ['a']
</div>
Then x is y evaluates to False. Because lists are mutable, this is the only
correct way to implement lists.

The situation with strings (also immutable) is similar but more complicated.
Whether "is" operating on two strings with the same characters is True depends
on things like the length of the strings and whether the string was computed or
entered by the user in the console. If we write

<div class = "diagram">
x = 'ab'
y = 'a'+'b'
z = input('Enter string') # and enter the string ab when prompted
</div>
x is y evaluates to True, but x is z evaluates to False. As with integers, it is
best to compare strings with == and != and not use the "is" or "is not"
operators on them.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "comprehension">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Comprehensions: list, tuple, set, dict</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
<b>List, Tuple, Set Comprehensions:</b>

Comprehensions are compact ways to create complicated (but not too complicated)
lists, tuples, sets, and dicts. That is, they compactly solve some problems but
cannot solve all problems (for example, we cannot use them to mutate values in
an existing data structure, just to create values in a new data structure). The
general form of a list comprehension is as follows, where f means any function
using var (or expression using var: we can also write just var there because a
name by itself is a very simple expression) and p means any predicate (or bool
expresssion) using var.

<div class = "diagram">
[f(var,...) for var in iterable if p(var,...)]
</div>
Meaning: collect together into a list (list because of the outer []) all of
f(var,...) values, for var taking on every value in iterable, but only collect
an f(var,...) value if its corresponding p(var,...) is True.

For tuple or set comprehensions, we would use () and {} as the outermost
grouping symbol instead of []. We'll talk about dicts later in this section:
they use also use {} but also include a : inside (separating keys from values)
to be distinguised from sets, which use {} without any such : inside.

Note that the "if p(var,...)" part is optional, so we can also write the
simplest comprehensions as follows (in which case it has the same meaning as
p(var,...) always being True).

<div class = "diagram">
[f(var,...) for var in iterable]
</div>
   which has the same meaning as

<div class = "diagram">
[f(var,...) for var in iterable if True]
</div>
for example
<div class = "diagram">
x = [i**2 for i in irange(1,10) if i%2==0]  # note: irange not range
print(x)
</div>
prints the squares of all the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive, but only if the
integer is even (computed as leaving a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). Run 
it. Change it a bit to get is to do something else. Here is another example

<div class = "diagram">
x = [2*c for c in 'some text' if c in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz']
print(x)
</div>
which prints a list with strings with doubled characters for all the consonants
(no aeiouy -or spaces for that matter) in the string 'some text':
['ss', 'mm', 'tt', 'xx', 'tt'].

We can translate any list comprehension into equivalent code that uses more
familiar Python looping/if/list appending features.

<div class = "diagram">
x = []                 # start with an empty list
for var in iterable:     # iterate through iterable
   if p(var):      # if var is acceptable?
       x.append(f(var))    # add f(var) next in the list
</div>
But often using a comprehension (in the right places: where you want to
create from scratch some list, tuple, set or dict) is simpler. Not all lists
that we build can be written as simple comprehensions, but the ones that can
are often very simple to write, read, and understand when written as
comprehensions. They tend to be more efficient too.

What comprehensions aren't good for is putting information into a data structure
and then mutating/changing it during the execution of the comprehension; for
that job you need code more like the for loop above. So when deciding whether or
not to use a comprehension, ask youself if you can specify each value in the
data structure once, without changing it (as was done above, using
comprehensions). Or try to write the code as a comprehension first; if you
fail, then try to write it using more complicated statements in Python.

Note that we can add-to (mutate) lists, sets, and dicts, but not tuples. For
tuples we would have to write this code with x = () at the top and
x = x + (var,) in the middle: which builds an entirely new tuple by
concatenating the old one and a one-tuple (containing only x) and then binding
x to the newly constructed tuple. For large tuples, this process is very slow.
Don't worry about these details, but understand that unlike lists and sets,
tuples have no mutator methods: so x.append(...)/x.add(...) is not allowed.

Here is something interesting (using a set comprehension: notice {} around the
comprehension.

<div class = "diagram">
x = {c for c in "I've got plenty of nothing"} # note ' in str delimited by "
print(sorted(x))
</div>
It prints a set of characters (printing in a list, in sorted order, created by
sorted(x)) in the string but because it is a set, each character occurs one
time). So even though a few c's have the same value, only one of each appears in
the set because of the semantics/meaning of sets. Note it prints as as the list

<div class = "diagram">
[' ', "'", 'I', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 'o', 'p', 't', 'v', 'y']
</div>
because sorted takes the iterable set created and produces a sorted list as a
result.

If we used a list comprehension instead of a set comprehension, the result would
be much longer because, for example, the character 't' would occur 3 times in a
list (but occurs only once in a set).

Note the following: binding values to for loop variables (both outside/inside
of comprehensions) do not affect the same variable name outside the scope of
the for loop. Both
<div class = "diagram">
x = 'ABC'                 x = 'ABC'
for x in range(1,5):    y = [x for x in range(1,5)]
   pass       print(x)
print(x)
</div>
print ABC after the loop/comprehension finishes. The x outside the loop (or
comprehension) is considered a different variable than the x inside the loop
(or comprehension). The reason is similar to why
<div class = "diagram">
x = 'ABC'
def f():
  x = 1
f()
print(x)
</div>
also prints ABC after the function call. A for loop (like a function) creates
its own scope for the loop's index variable(s) - remember there can be more
than one. 

<b>Dict Comprehensions:</b>

The form for dict comprehensions is similar, here k and v are functions (or
expressions) using var. Notice the {} on the outside and the : on the inside,
separating the key from the value. That is how Python knows the comprehension
is a dict not a set.

<div class = "diagram">
{k(var,...) : v(var,...) for var in iterable if p(var,...)}
</div>
So,
<div class = "diagram">

x = {k : len(k) for k in ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']}
print(x)
</div>
prints a dictionary that stores keys that are these five words whose associated
values are the lengths of these words. Because dicts aren't ordered, it could
print as {'four': 4, 'three': 5, 'one': 3, 'five': 4, 'two': 3}

Finally, we can write a nested comprehension, although they are harder to
understand than simple comprehensions.
<div class = "diagram">

x = {c for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york'] for c in word if c not in 'aeiou'}
print(x)
</div>
It says to collect c's, by looking in each word in the list, and looking at
each character c in each word: so the c collected at the beginning is the c
being iterated over in the second part of the comprehension (for c in word...).

It prints a set of each different letter that is not a vowel, in each word
in the list. I could produce this same result by rewriting the outer part of the
comprehension as a loop, but leaving the inner one as a comprehension (union
merges two sets: does a bunch of adds).
<div class = "diagram">

x = set()                    # empty set: cannot use {} which is an empty dict
for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']:
    x = x.union( {c for c in word if c not in 'aeiou'} )
print(x)
</div>
or write it with no comprehensions at all
<div class = "diagram">

x = set()
for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']:
    for c in word:
        if c not in 'aeiou':
            x.add(c)
print(x)
</div>
So which of these is the most comprehendable: the pure comprehension, the
hybrid loop/comprehension, or the pure nested loops? What is important is that
we know how all three work, can write each correctly in any of these ways,
and then we can decide afterwords which way we want the code to appear. As we
program more, our preferences might change. I'd probably prefer the first one
(because I've seen lots of double comprehensions), but the middle one is
also reasonable.

What do you think the following nested (in a different way) comprehension
produces?
<div class = "diagram">

x = {word : {c for c in word} for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']}
</div>
Check your answer by executing this code in Python and printing x.

Finally, here is a version of myprint (written above in the section on the
binding of arguments and parameters) that uses a combination of the .join
function and a comprehension to create the string to print simply.

The .join function (discussed more in depth below) joins all the string values
in an iterable into a string using the prefix operator as a separator:
'--'.join( ['My', 'dog', 'has', 'fleas'] )
returns the string 'My--Dog--has--fleas'
<div class = "diagram">

def myprint(*args,sep=' ',end='\n'):
    s = sep.join(str(x) for x in args)+end       # create string to print
    print(s,end='')        # print the string
</div>

<div class = "warning">
WARNING: Once students learn about comprehensions, sometimes they go a bit
overboard as they learn about/use this feature. Here are some warning signs:
When writing a comprehension, you should (1) use the result produced in a later
part of the computation and (2) typically not mutate anything in the
comprehension. If the purpose of your computation is to mutate something,
don't use a comprehension. Over time you will develop good instincts for when
to use comprehensions.
</div>

<b>Tuple Comprehensions are special:</b>

The result of a tuple comprehension is special. You might expect it to produce
a tuple, but what it does is produce a special "generator" object that we can
iterate over. We will discuss generators in detail later in the quarter, so for
now we will examine just some simple examples. Given the code

<div class = "diagram">

x = (i for i in 'abc')  # tuple comprehension
print(x)
</div>
You might expect this to print as ('a', 'b', 'c') but it prints as
(generator object (genexpr) at 0x02AAD710>

The result of a tuple comprehension is not a tuple: it is actually a generator.
The only thing that you need to know now about a generator is just that you can
iterate over it, but ONLY ONCE. So, given the code

<div class = "diagram">

x = (i for i in 'abc')
for i in x:
    print(i)
for i in x:
    print(i)
</div>
it prints
<div class = "diagram">

a
b
c
</div>
Yes, it prints a, b, c and just prints it once: after the first loop finishes,
the generator is exhausted so the second loop prints no more values. We will
spend a whole lecture studying the details of generators later in the quarter.

Specifically, if x is defined as above, we cannot call len(x) or x[1]: it is
not a tuple, it is a generator. All we can do it iterate over x.

Recall our discussion of changing any iterable into a list, tuple, or set by
iterating over it; we can iterate over a tuple comprehension. So if we wrote
t  = tuple(x) or t = tuple( (i for i in 'abc') ), then print(t) would print
('a', 'b', 'c'). In fact, we could even write t = tuple(i for i in 'abc')
because (1) by default, comprehensions are tuple comprehensions; (2) in a
function call with exactly one argument, we can omit the () specifying a tuple
comprehension (but with multiple arguments we must supply the parentheses).

Of course, we could also write things like :
<div class = "diagram">

l = list(i for i in 'abc')
s = set (i for i in 'abc')
</div>
but these are equivalent to writing the standard comprehensions more simply
(and efficiently) as:
<div class = "diagram">

l = [i for i in 'abc']
s = {i for i in 'abc'}
</div>
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "useful_functions">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The split/join methods</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Both split and join are methods in the str class: if s is some string, we call
them by writing s.split(...) or s.join(....)

The split method also takes one str argument as .... and the result it returns
is a  list of of str. For example 'ab;c;ef;;jk'.split(';') returns the list of
str
<div class = "diagram">

['ab', 'c', 'ef', '', 'jk']
</div>
It uses the argument str ';' to split up the string (the one prefixing the
.split call), into slices that come before or after every ';'.

Note that there is an empty string between 'ef' and 'j' because two adjacent
semi-colons appear between them in the string. If we wanted to filter out such
empty strings, we can easily do so by embedding the call to split inside a
comprehension: writing [s for s in 'ab;c;ef;;jk'.split(';') if s != '']
produces the list ['ab', 'c', 'ef', 'jk'].

Because the prefix and regular arguments are both strings, students sometime
reverse these two operands: what does ';'.split('ab;c;ef;;jk') produce and why?

The split method is very useful to call after reading lines of text from a file,
to parse (split) these lines into their important constituent information.
You will use split in all 5 parts of Programming Assignment #1.

-----

The join method also takes one iterable argument (it must produce str values) 
as ....; the result it returns is a str. 
For example
<div class = "diagram">

';'.join(['ab', 'c', 'ef', '', 'jk']) returns the str

'ab;c;ef;;jk'
</div>
It merges all the strings produced by iterating over its argument into one big
string, with all the strings produced by iterating over its argument
concatenated together and separated from each other by the ';' string.

So, split and join are opposites. Unfortunately, the splitting/joining string
';' appears as the argument inside the () in split, but it appears as the prefix
argument before the call in join. This inconsistency can be confusing.

<div id = "allany">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The all/any functions (and their use with tuple comprehensions)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
The "all" function takes one iterable argument (and returns a bool value): it
returns True if ALL the bool values produced by the iterable are True; it can
stop examining values and return a False result when the first False is produced
(ultimately, if no False is produced it returns True).

The "any" function takes one iterable argument (and returns a bool value): it
returns True if ANY the bool values produced by the iterable are True; it can
stop examining values and return a True result when the first True is produced
(ultimately, if no True is produced it returns False).

These functions can be used nicely with tuple comprehensions. For example, if
we have a list l of numbers, and we want to know whether all these numbers are
prime, we can call
<div class = "diagram">

  all( predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l )
</div>
which is the same as calling
<div class = "diagram">

  all( (predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l) )
</div>
and similar (but more time/space-efficient) than calling
<div class = "diagram">

  all( [predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l] )
</div>
The list comprehension computes the entire list of boolean values and then
"all" iterates over this list. When "all" iterates over a tuple comprehension,
the tuple comprehension computes values one at a time and "all" checks each: if
one is False, the tuple comprehension returns False immediately and does not
have to compute any further values in the tuple comprehension.

<b>-----Efficiency Interlude</b>
The tupel comprehension version can be much more efficient, if a False value is
followed by a huge number of other values.

For example, calling
<div class = "diagram">

all( predicate.is_prime(x) for x in range(2,1000000) )
</div>
immediately returns False because it checks whetehr 2 is prime (True), 3 is
prime (True), 4 isn't prime (False: so all finishes executing, returning False).

But calling
<div class = "diagram">

all( [predicate.is_prime(x) for x in range(2,1000000)] )
</div>
takes a very long time to return False. It first determines whether all values
from 2 to 1,000,000 are prime (putting all these boolean values in the list
comprehension), and then looks at the first (True), the second (True), the
third (False: so all finishes executing, returning False).

This illustrates the very important difference between tuple comprehension and
other kinds of comprehensions.
<b>-----End: Efficiency Interlude</b>

Likewise for the "any" function, which produces True the first time it examines
a True value.

Here is how we can write these functions, which search for a False or a True
respectively:
<div class = "diagram">

def all(iterable):
    for v in iterable:
        if v == False
            return False  # something was False; return False immediately
    return True           # nothing   was False; return True after loop

def any(iterable):
    for v in iterable:
        if v == True
            return True   # something was True; return True immediately
    return False          # nothing   was True; return False after loop
</div>
Read these functions. What does each produce if the iterable produces no values?
Why is that reasonable?
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "sum_max_min">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The sum/max/min functions (and their use with tuple comprehensions)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
The simple versions of the sum function takes one iterable argument. The sum
function requires that the iterable produce numeric values that can be added.
It returns the sum of all the values produced by the iterable; if the iterable
argument produces no values, sum returns 0. Actually, we can supply a second
argument to the sum function; in this case, that value will be returned in the
special case when the iterable produces no values; if the iterable does produce
any values, the sum will be the actual sum plus this argument. We can think of
sum as defined by
<div class = "diagram">

def sum(values, init_sum=0):
    result = init_sum
    for v in values:
        result += v
    return result
</div>
The simple versions of the max and min functions also each take one iterable
argument.

The min/max functions require that the iterable produce values that can be
compared with each other; so calling min([2,1,3]) returns 1; and calling
min(['b','a','c']) returns 'a';  but calling min([2,'a',3]) raises a TypeError
exception because Python cannot compare an integer to a string. These functions
return the minimum/maximum value produced by their iterable argument; if the
iterable produces no values (e.g., min([]), min and max each raise a ValueError
exception, because there is no minimum/maximum value that it can compute/return.

There are two more interesting properties to learn about the min and max
functions.

First, we can also call min/max specifying any number of arguments or if one
argument, it must be iterable: so calling min([1,2,3,4]) -using a tuple which it
iterable- produces the same result as calling min(1,2,3,4) -using 4 arguments.

We can also specify a named argument in min/max: a key function just like the
key function used in sort/sorted. The min/max functions return the
smallest/largest value in its argument(s), but if the key function is supplied,
it compares two values by calling the key function on each, not by directly
comparing these two value.

For example, min('abcd','xyz') returns 'abcd', because 'abcd' < 'xyz'. But if
we instead wrote min('abcd','xyz',key = (lambda x : len(x)) ) it would return
'xyz' because len('xyz') < len('abcd'): that is, it compares the key function
applied to all values in the iterable to determine which value to return.

Note that min('abcd','wxyz',key = (lambda x : len(x)) ) will return 'abcd'
because it is the first value that has the smallest result when the key
function is called: the key function returns 4 for both values. We can think of
the min function operating on an iterable to be written as follows (although we
will learn Python features later on that simplifies the actual definition of
this function)

<div class = "diagram">

def min(*args,key = (lambda x : x) ): # default key is the identity function
    if len(args) == 0:
        raise TypeError('min: expected >=1 arguments, got 0')
    if len(args) == 1:     # Assume that if min has just one argument
        args = args[0]     #   it's iterable, so take the max over its values

    answer = None
    for v in args:
        key_of_v = key(v)
        if answer == None or key_of_v < key_of_answer:
            answer = v
            key_of_answer = key_of_v

    return answer
</div>
Calling min( ('abc','def','gh','ij'),key = (lambda x : len(x)) ) returns 'gh'.
Note that the default value for the key function is a lambda that returns the
value it is passed: this is called the identity function/lambda.

<div id = "zip">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The zip and enumerate functions</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
<b>Zip:</b>

There is a very interesting function called zip that takes an arbitrary number
of iterable arguments and zips/interleaves them together (like a zipper does
for the teeth on each side). Let's start by looking at just the two argument
version of zip.

What zip actually produces is a generator -the ability to get the results of
zipping- not the result itself. See the discussion above about how tuple
comprehensions produce generators.

So to "get the result itself" we should use a for loop or constructor (as shown
in most of the examples below) to iterate over the generator result of calling
zip. The following code
<div class = "diagram">

z = zip( 'abc', (1, 2, 3) )           # String and tuple are iterator arguments
print('z:', z, 'list of z:', list(z))
</div>
prints
<div class = "diagram">
z: (zip object at 0x02A4D990) list of z: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
</div>
Here, z refers to a zip generator object; the result of using z in the list
constructor is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)] which zips/interleaves the values
from the first iterable and the values from the second:
[(first from first,first from second),(second from first,second from second),  
 (third from first,third from second)]

What happens when the iterables are of different lengths? Try it.
<div class = "diagram">

z = zip( 'abc', (1, 2) )  # String and tuple for iterables
print(list(z))      # prints [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]
</div>
So when one iterable runs out of values to produce, the process stops. Here is
a more complex example with three iterable parameters of all different sizes.
Can you predict the result it prints: do so, and only then run the code.
<div class = "diagram">

z = zip( 'abcde', (1, 2, 3), ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th'] )
print(list(z))
</div>
which prints
<div class = "diagram">

[('a', 1, '1st'), ('b', 2, '2nd'), ('c', 3, '3rd')]
</div>
Of course, this generalizes for any number of arguments, interleaving them all
(from first to last) until any iterable runs out of values. So the number of
values in the result is the minimum of the number of values of the argument 
iterables.

Note one very useful way to use zip: suppose we want to iterate over values in
two iterables simultaneously, i1 and i2, operating on the first pair of values
in each, the second pair of values in each, etc. We can use zip to do this by
writing:
<div class = "diagram">

for v1,v2 in zip(i1,i2):
    process v1 and v2: the next pair of values in each
</div>
So
<div class = "diagram">

for v1,v2 in zip ( ('a','b','c'), (1,2,3) ):
    print(v1,v2)
</div>
prints
<div class = "diagram">

a 1
b 2
c 3
</div>
Using zip, we can write a small function that computes the equivalent of the
< (less than) operator for strings in Python (see the discussion above about
the meaning of < for strings).
<div class = "diagram">

def less_than(s1 : str, s2 : str)-> bool:
    for c1,c2 in zip(s1,s2):   # examine 1st, 2nd, ... characters of each string
        if c1 != c2:           # if current characters are different
            return c1 < c2     #   compute result by comparing characters

    # if all character from the shorter are the same (as in 'a' and 'ab')
    # return a result based on the length of the strings
    return len(s1)< len(s2)
</div>
This precisely caputures in Python code our prose discussion of the meaning of
comparing strings.

<b>Enumerate:</b>

Finally, this is a convenient time to toss in another important function:
enumerate. It also also produces a generator as a result, but has just one
iterable argument, and an optional 2nd argument that is a starting number. It
produces tuples whose first values are numbers (starting at the value of the
second parameter; omit a 2nd parameter and unsurprisingly, the starting number
is 0) and whose second values are the values in the iterable. So, if we write

<div class = "diagram">

e = enumerate(['a','b','c','d'], 5)
print(list(e))
</div>
it prints 
<div class = "diagram">

[(5, 'a'), (6, 'b'), (7, 'c'), (8, 'd')]
</div>
Given l = ['a','b','c','d','e'] we could write the following code

<div class = "diagram">

for i in range(len(l)):
    print(i+1,l[i])
</div>
(which prints 1 a, 2 b, 3 c, 4 d, and 5 e on separate lines) more simply by
using enumerate (notice the use of parallel/tuple assignment for i,x):
<div class = "diagram">

for i,x in enumerate(l,1):
     print(i,x)
</div>
Another nice example illustrating enumerate is reading a file a line at a time,
and processing the line number and the line contents.

Instead of writing 
<div class = "diagram">

line_number = 1
for line in open("file-name"):
    .... process line_number and line
    line_number += 1
</div>
we can write just
<div class = "diagram">

for line_number, line in enumerate(open("file-name"),1):
    .... process line_number and line
</div>
You might ask now, why do these things (tuple comprehension, zip, enumerate)
produce generators and not just tuples or lists? That is an excellent question.
It goes right along with the excellent question why does sorted(...) produce a
list and not a generator? We will discuss these issues later in the quarter.
The generator question mostly has to do with space efficiency when iterating
over very  many values. The sorted question has to do with why there is no way
to do this operation in a space efficient way.
</pre>
</div>
<hr>

<div id = "condition">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">**kargs for dictionary of not-matched named arguments in function calls</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Recall the use of *args in a function parameter list. It combines into one
tuple a sequence of positional arugments. We can also write the symbol **kargs
(we can write ** and any word, but kargs or kwargs are the standard ones). If
we use it to specify this kind of parameter, it must occur as the last
parameter. kargs stands for keyword arguments. Basically, if Python has any 
keywords arguments that do not match keyword parameters (see the large
discussion of argument/paramteter binding above, which includes *args but
doesn't include **kargs) they are all put in a dictionary that is stored in the
last parameter named kargs.

So, imagine we define the following function
<div class = "diagram">

def f(a,b,**kargs):
  print(a,b,kargs)
</div>
and call it by
<div class = "diagram">

f(c=3,a=1,b=2,d=4)
</div>
it prints: 1 2 {'c': 3, 'd': 4}

Without **kargs, using the rules specified before, Python would report a
TypeError exception (by rule M5(d)), because there are no parameter named
c or d. 

By the new rules, Python finds two named arguments (c=3 and d=4) whose names
did not appear as parameter names in the function header of f (which specifies
only a and b, and of course the special **kargs), so while Python directly
binds a to 1 and b to 2 (the parameter names specified in the function header,
matched to similarly named arguments) it creates a dictionary with all the
other named arguments: {'c': 3, 'd': 4} and binds kargs to that dict.

The same result would be printed for the call
<div class = "diagram">

f(1,2,d=4,c=3)
</div>
We will use **kargs to understand a special use of of dict constructors (below).
We will also use **kargs (and learn something new in the process) when
discussing how to (1) call methods in decorators and (2) call overridden
methods using inheritance much later in the quarter.

Note that to write a perfectly general function that is called with any kinds
of arguments we can write
<div class = "diagram">

def g(*args,**kargs):
  print(args,kargs)
</div>
Now, any legal call of g (one with any legal combination of positional and
named arguments) will populate the *args and **kargs structures appropriately.

Calling
<div class = "diagram">

g(1,2,c=3,d=4)     prints (1, 2) {'c': 3, 'd': 4}
g(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4) prints () {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1, 'd': 4}
</div>
Generally, when a parameter name is prefixed by * and ** in a function header,
we omit the prefix when we use the parameter name inside the function. But
there are times where use use the * and ** prefixes.
<div class = "diagram">

def h(a,b,c,d):
    print(a,b,c,d)

def i(*args,**kargs):
  h(*args,**kargs)
</div>
The arguments *args and **kargs in the call of h expand the args tuple to
be positional arguments and the **kargs dictionary to be named arguments

Calling
<div class = "diagram">

i(1,2,c=3,d=4)     prints 1 2 3 4: it calls h(1,2,c=3,d=4)
i(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4) prints 1 2 3 4: it calls h(c=3,b=2,a=1,d=4)
</div>

<div class = "info">

Summarizing:

1) Writing * and ** when specifying parameters makes those parameters names
   bind to a tuple/dict respectively.

2) Using the parameter names by themselves in the function is equivalent to 
    using the tuple/dict respectively.

3) Using * and ** followed by the parameter name as ARGUMENTS IN FUNCTION
   CALLS expands all the values in the tuple/dict respectively to represent
   all the arguments.
</div>
Experiment with *args/**kargs as parameters of functions and args/kargs and
*args/**kargs as arguments to other function calls.

We have seen that to call sorted with a lambda we must write something like
<div class = "diagram">

  sorted(iterable, key = (lambda ...))
</div>
One might ask, is the key paraemeter to sorted the second one? Could we write
<div class = "diagram">

  sorted(iterable, (labmda ...))
</div>
to accomplish the same call? The answer is "no" we cannot. If we want to use
a lambda, we must write a named argument as  key = (lambda ...). Similarly, we
must write reverse = ....

How do you think the header of the sorted function is written?

<div id = "frozenset">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries (frozenset and defaultdict)</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
You need to have pretty good grasp of these important data types, meaning how to
construct them and the common methods/operations we can call on them. Really
you should get familiar with reading the online documentation for all these
data types (see the Python Library Reference link on the homepage for the
course).
<div class = "warning">

4. 6: Sequence Types includes Lists (mutable) and Tuples (immutable)
4. 9: Set Types includes set (mutable) and frozenset (immutable)
4.10: Mapping Types includes dict and defaultdict (both mutable)
</div>
Here is a very short/condensed summary of these operations. Experiment with
them in Eclipse.

-----
<div class = "diagram">

4.6: Sequence Types includes Lists (mutable) and Tuples (immutable)
These sequence operations (operators and functions) are defined in 4.6.1
   x in s, x not in s, s + t, s * n, s[i], s[i:j], s[i:j:k], len(s), min(s), 
   max(s), s.index(x[, i[, j]]), s.count(x)

Mutable sequence allow the following operations, defined in 4.6.3
  s[i] = x , s[i:j] = t, del s[i], s[i:j:k] = t, del s[i:j:k], s.append(x)
  s.clear(), s.copy(), s.extend(t), s.insert(i, x), s.pop(), s.pop(i),
  s.remove(x), s.reverse()

  It also discusses list/tuple constructors and sort for list.

  note that the append method is especially important for building up sequences
  like lists. Also to return and remove a value from a sequence, we call
    x = s.pop(i)
  is equivalent to 
    x = s[i]
    del s[i]
  and calling s.pop() uses the value len(s)-1 (the last index in the sequence)
</div>
-----
<div class = "diagram">

4. 9: Set Types includes set (mutable) and frozenset (immutable)
These set (operators and functions) are defined in 4.6.1.9
  len(s), x in s, x not in s, isdisjoint(other), issubset(other), set <= other, 
  set < other, issuperset(other), set >= other, set > other, union(other, ...),
  intersection(other, ...), difference(other, ...), symmetric_difference(other),
  copy; also the operators | (for union), & (for intersection), - (for
  difference), and ^ (for symmetic difference)

Sets, which are mutable, allow the following operations
  update(other, ...), intersection_update(other, ...),
  difference_update(other, ...), symmetric_difference_update(other), add(elem),
  remove(elem), discard(elem), pop(), clear(); also the operators |= (union
  update), &= (intersection update), -= (difference update), ^= (symmetric
  difference update)
</div>
-----
<div class = "diagram">

4.10: Mapping Types includes dict and defaultdict (both mutable)
These dict (operators and functions) are defined in 4.10
  d[key] = value , del d[key], key in d, key not in d, iter(d), clear(), copy(),
  fromkeys(seq[, value]), get(key[, default]), items(), keys(),
  pop(key[, default]), popitem(), setdefault(key[, default]), update([other]),
  values() 

Important Notes on dicts:
  d[k] returns the value associated with a key (raises exception if k not in d)

  d.get(k,default) returns d[k] if k in d; returns default if k not in d
    it is equivalent to the conditional expression (d[k] if k in d else default)

  d.setdefault(k,default) returns d[k] if k in d; if k not in d it
    (a) sets d[k] = default
    (b) returns d[k]
  writing d.setdefault(k,default) is equivalent to (but more efficient than)
  writing
      if k in d:
          return d[k]
      else
          d[k] = default
          return d[k]
</div>
There is a type called defaultdict (see 8.3.4) whose constructor generally
takes an argument that is a reference to any object that CAN BE CALLED WITH NO
ARGUMENTS. Very frequently we use a NAME OF A CLASS that when called will
CONSTRUCT A NEW VALUE: if the argument is int, it will call int() producing the
value 0; if the argument is list, it will call list() producing an empty list;
if the argument is set, it will call set() producing an empty set; etc.

Whenever a key is accessed for the first time (i.e., that key is accessed but
not already associated with a value in the dictionary) in a defaultdictionary,
it will associate that key with the value created by calling the reference to
the object supplied to the constructor.

Here is an example of program first written with a dict, and simplified later
by using a defaultdict. 

<div class = "diagram">

letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = dict()             # could use = {}
for l in letters:
    if l not in freq_dict:     # must check l in freq_dict before freq_dict[l]
        freq_dict[l] = 1       # if not there, put with frequency of 1
    else:
        freq_dict[l] += 1      # otherwise there, increment frequency
print(freq_dict)
</div>
This would print the following dict: {'b': 1, 'x': 3, 'f': 1, 'a': 2}

As each letter in the loop is processed, it is associated with 1 (if not already
in the dict) or it is in the dict, and its associated value is incremented by 1.

We could solve this a bit more easily with a defaultdict.

<div class = "diagram">

from collections import defaultdict # in same module as namedtuple
letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = defaultdict(int)   # int not int(); but int() returns 0 when called
for l in letters:
    freq_dict[l] += 1        # in dict, exception raised if l not in d, but
print(freq_dict)               #   defaultdict calls int() putting 0 there first
</div>
As each letter in the loop is processed, its associated key is looked up:
if the key is absent, it it placed in the dict assocatiated with int()/0; then
then the associated value (possibly the one just put in the dict) is
incremented by 1.

The dict code below is equivalent to how the defaultdict code above works.
<div class = "diagram">

letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = dict()         # could use = {}
for l in letters:
    if l not in freq_dict:     # must check l in freq_dict before freq_dict[l]
        freq_dict[l] = int()   # int() constructor returns 0; could write 0 here
    freq_dict[l] += 1        # l is guaranteed in freq_dict, either because
print(freq_dict)         #   it was there originally, or just put there
</div>
Another way to do the same thing (but also a bit longer and less efficient)
uses the setdefault method (listed above)
<div class = "diagram">

letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = dict()         # note dict only
for l in letters:
    freq_dict[l] = freq_dict.setdefault(l,0) + 1
print(freq_dict)             
</div>
Here we evaluate the right side of the = first; if l is already in the dict,
its associated value is returned; if not, l is put in the map with an associated
value of 0, then this assocated value is returned (and then incremented, and
stored back into freq_dict[l] replacing the 0 just put there).

You should achieve a good understanding of why each of these four scripts work
and why they all produce equivalent results.

Often we use defaultdicts with list instead of int: just as int() produces the
object 0 associated with a new key, list() creates an empty list associated
with a new key (and later we add things to that list); likewise we can use
defaultdicts with set to get an empty set with a new key.

So, if we wrote x = defaultdict(list) and then immediately wrote
x['bob'].append(1) then x['bob'] is associated with the list [1] (the empty
list, with 1 appended to it). If we then wrote x['bob'].append(2), then
x['bob'] is associated with the list [1, 2]. So, we can always append to the
value associated with a key, because it will use an empty list to start the
process if there is nothing associated with a key.

How could we specify a defaultdict that initializes keys with the value 5?
Translation: in what simple way can we pass to defaultdict an arguement that is
a function of no parameters, which returns the value 5. The solution can lead 
to all sorts of interesting variants, say for a defaultdict whose unknown keys
are automatically associated with a dict (or another defaultdict).

Note that the ==/!= operators for dictionaries work correct between dicts and
defaultdicts. They are considered equal so long as they have the equal keys, and
each key is associated with an equal value.

Just as with comprehensions, what is important is that we know how things like
defaultdicts and dicts (with the setdefault method) work, so that we can
correctly write code in any of these ways. We can decide afterwords which way
we want the code to appear. As we program more, our preferences might change.
I have found defaultdicts are mostly what I to use to simplify my code, but
every so often I must use a regular dict.

Later in the quarter we will use inheritance to show how to write the
defaultdict class simply, by extending the dict class.

<div id = "ordering">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Printing Dictionaries in Order: An example of using comprehensions and sorted</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this section we will combine our knowledge about the sorted function,
comprehensions, and iteratring over dictionaries to examine how we can print
(or generally process) dictionaries in arbitrary orders.

Generally, all of our code will be of the form
<div class = "diagram">

  for index(es) in sorted( iterable, key = (lambda x : ....) ):
     print( index(es) )
</div>
In these examples, we will use the simple dictionary
<div class = "diagram">

   d = {'x': 3, 'b': 1, 'a': 2, 'f': 1}
</div>
In each example, we will discuss the relationships among index(es), iterable,
and the (lambda x : ....) in the function bound to the key parameter.

<div class = "info">
1) In the first example, we will print the dictionary keys in increasing
alphabetical order, and their associated values, by iterating over d.items().
<div class = "diagram">

for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = (lambda item : item[0]) ):
   print(k,'->',v)
</div>
which prints as

<div class = "diagram">
a -> 2
b -> 1
f -> 1
x -> 3
</div>
Here, iterable is d.items(), which produces 2-tuples storing each key and its
associated value, for every item in the dictionary; the item in lambda item is
also a key/value 2-tuple (specifying here to sort by item[0], the key part in
the 2-tuple); finally, the list returned by sorted also contains key/value
2-tuples, which are unpacked into k and v and printed.

We can solve this same problem by iterating over just the keys in d as well.

<div class = "diagram">

for k in sorted( d.keys(), key = (lambda k : k) ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])
</div>
Here, iterable is d.keys() which produces strings storing each key in the
dictionary; the k in lambda k is also a key/str value (specifying here to
sort by k, the key itself: I could have omitted this identity lambda); finally,
the list returned by sorted also contains key/str value, which are stored into
k and printed along with d[k].

This code is equivalent to the following, since d.keys() is the same as just d,
and lambda x : x is the default for the key parameter.

<div class = "diagram">

for k in sorted( d ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])
</div>

2) In the second example, we will print the dictionary keys and their associated
values, in increasing order of the values, by iterating over d.items().
<div class = "diagram">

for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = (lambda item : item[1]) ):
   print(k,'->',v)
</div>
which prints as
<div class = "diagram">

b -> 1
f -> 1
a -> 2
x -> 3
</div>
Here, iterable is d.items(), which produces 2-tuples storing each key and its
associated value, for every item in the dictionary; the item in lambda item is
also a key/value 2-tuple (specifying here to sort by item[1], the value part in
the 2-tuple); also, the list returned by sorted also contains key/value
2-tuples, which are unpacked into k and v and printed. Finally, by this
lambda either b or f might be printed first, because they have the same value
associated with them.

We can solve this same problem by iterating over just the keys in d as well.

<div class = "diagram">

for k in sorted( d.keys(), key = (lambda k : d[k]) ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])
</div>
Here, iterable is d.keys() which produces strings storing each key in the
dictionary; the k in lambda k is also a key/str value (specifying here to sort
by d[k], the value associated with the key); finally, the list returned by
sorted also contains key/str values, which are stored into k and printed along
with d[k].

This code is equivalent to the following, since d.keys() is the same a d; the
lambda is still needed here because it is not the identity lambda.

<div class = "diagram">

for k in sorted( d, key = (lambda k : d[k]) ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])
</div>
In both cases, Python uses the LEGB rule: d is not a parameter to the lambda,
but it might be defined in the Enclosing or Global scope, so it can be used
in the lambda.

3) In the third example, we will compute a list that contains all the keys in a
dictionary, sorted by their associated values (in decreasing order of the
values), by iterating over d.keys() (really just d, to simplify the code)

We compute

<div class = "diagram">

ks = sorted(d, key = (lambda k : d[k]), reverse = True)

ks stores ['x', 'a', 'b', 'f'].
</div>
We could also compute this list less elegantly using d.items().; I say less
elegantly, because we need a comprehension to "throw away" the value part of
each item returned by sorted.

<div class = "diagram">

ks = [k for k,v in sorted(d.items(), key=(lambda item : item[1]), reverse=True)]
</div>

4) Finally, in the fourth example, we will compute a list that contains all the
2-tuples in the items of d, but the tuples are reversed (values before keys) and
sorted in increasing alphabetical order by keys.

We compute this list of 2-tuple in the following two ways

<div class = "diagram">

vks = [ (v,k) for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = (lambda item : item[0]) ) ]
vks = sorted( ((v,k) for k,v in d.items()), key = (lambda item : item[1]) )

vks stores [(2, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'f'), (3, 'x')]
</div>
The top computation first creates a sorted version of d by keys, and then uses a
comprehension to create tuples that reverse the keys/values; the bottom
computation first uses a comprehension to create a list of reversed keys/values,
and then uses sorted to sort these reversed 2-tuples by the keys that are now
in the second part of each tuple.


<b>Using _ as a variable Name:</b>

If you write 

<div class = "diagram">

  ks = [k for k,v in list_of-2-tuples...]
</div>
Eclipse will likely give you warning about "variable v is not used". Since
there must be variable to store the second tuple index, but that variable does
not get used, we can write it as just _ (a legal Python variable name)

<div class = "diagram">

  ks = [k for k,_ in list_of-2-tuples...]
</div>
In this case, Eclipse does not indicate a warning. Naming a variable _ implies
you aren't going to to anything useful with it. Although, we can write

<div class = "diagram">

for _ in [1,2,3]:
    print(_)
</div>
and it will print 1, 2, and 3 (on their own lines). By using _ Eclipse
doesn't expect this name to be used.
</div>

<div id = "exceptions">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Exceptions: example from prompt_for_int</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
We do two things with exceptions in Python: we raise them (with the raise
statement) and we handle them (with the try/except statement). Exceptions were
not in early programming languages, but were introduced big time in the Ada
language in the early 1980s, and have been parts of most new languages since
then.

A function raises an exception if it cannot do the job it is being asked to
do. Rather than fail silently, possibly producing a bogus answer that gets used
to compute a bogus result, it is better that the computation announces a problem
occurred and if no way is known to recover from it (see handling exceptions
below) the computation halts with an error message to the user.

For example, if your program has a list l and you write l[5] but l has nothing
stored at index 5 (its length is smaller), Python raises the IndexError
exception. If you haven't planned for this possibility, and told Python how to
handle the exception and continue the calculation, then the program just
terminates and Python prints: 

<div class = "diagram">

IndexError: list index out of range
</div>
Why doesn't it print the index value 5 and the lenth of list l?. I don't know.
That certainly seems like important and useful information, and Python knows
those two values. I try to make my exception messages include any information
useful to the programmer.

There are lots of ways to handle exceptions. Here is a drastically simplified
example from my prompt class (this isn't the real code, but a simplification
for looking at a good use of exception handling). But it does a good job of
introducing the try/except control form which tries to execute a block of code
and handles any exceptions it raises.

If we write a try/except and specify the name of no exception, it will handle
any exception. The name Exception is the name of the most generic exception.

We can write a try/except statement with many excepts, each one specifying a 
specific exception to handle, and what to do when that exception is raised. In
fact, int('x') raises the ValueError exception, so I use ValueError in the
except clause below to be specific, and not accidentally handle any other kind
of exception.

<div class = "diagram">

def prompt_for_int(prompt_text):
    while True:
        try:
            response = input(prompt_text+': ')    # response is used in except
            answer = int(response)
            return answer
        except ValueError:
            print('  You bozo, you entered "',response,'"',sep='')
      print('  That is not a legal int')

print(prompt_for_int('Enter a positive number'))
</div>
So, this is an "infinite" while loop, but there is a return statement at the
bottom of the try-block; if it gets executed, it returns from the function,
thus terminating the loop. The loop body is a try/except; the body of the
try/except

<div class = "info">
1) prompts the user to enter a string on the console (this cannot fail)

2) calls int(response) on the user's input (which can raise the ValueError
   exception, if the user types characters that cannot be interpreted as an
   integer)

3) if that exception is not raised, the return statement returns an int object
   representing the integer the user typed as a string
</div>
But if the exception is raised, it is handled by the except clause, which
prints some information. Now the try/except is finished, but it is in an
infinite loop, so it goes around the loop again, reprompting the user (over and
over until the user enters a legal int).

Actually, the body of try could be simplified (with the same behavior) to just
<div class = "diagram">

  response = input(prompt_text+': ')    # response is used in except
  return int(response)
</div>
If an exception is raised while the return statement is evaluating the int
function, it still gets handled in except. We CANNOT write it in one line
because the name response is used in the except clause (in the first print).
If this WASN'T the case, we could write just

<div class = "diagram">

  return int(input(prompt_text+': '))    # if response not used in except
</div>
For example, we might just say 'Illegal input' in the except, but in the example
above, it actually display the string (not a legal int) that the user typed.

Finally, in Java we throw and catch exceptions (obvious opposites, instead of
raise and handle) so I might sometimes use the wrong term. That is because I 
think more generally about programming than "in a language", and translate what
I'm thinking to the terminology of the language I am using, but sometime I get
it wrong.

Note that exception handling is very powerful, but should be avoided if a
boolean test can easily determine whether a computation will fail. For example.
<div class = "diagram">

l = [...]
if (0 <= i < len(l))
  print(l[i])

is preferred to

try:
  print(l[i])
except IndexError:
  pass

<div id = "namespace">
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Name Spaces (for objects): __dict__</h1>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Every object has a special variable named __dict__ that stores all its
namespace bindings in a dictionary. During this quarter we will systematically
study class names that start and end with two underscores. Writing x.a = 1
is similar to writing x.__dict__['a'] = 1; both associate a name with a value
in the object. We will explore the uses of this kind of knowledge in much more
depth later in the quarter.

Here is a brief illustration of the point above. Note that there is a small
Python script that illustrates the point. This is often the case.
<div class = "diagram">
class C:
    def __init__(self): pass

o = C()
o.a = 1
print(o.a)           # prints 1

o.__dict__['a'] = 2
print(o.a)           # prints 2

An empty dict is created by {} and empty set by set() (we can't use {} for an
empty set because Python would think it is a dict). Any non-empty dicts can
be distinguished from a non-empy set because a non-empty dict will always have
the : character inside {} separating keys from values. Suppose you want to
create a set containing the value 1: which works (and why)? {1} or set(1).

A one value tuple must be written like (1,) with that "funny" comma (we can't
write just (1) because that is just the value 1, not a tuple storing just 1).

3. What is printed in print(f(0)) if we define f as follows?
<div class = "diagram">

  def f(x):
      pass
</div>
4. Using the kind of pictures dicussed in the Binding section above, illustrate
the meaning of a module named m that contains the following statements:
<div class = "diagram">

  x = 1
  y = 2
  z = y
</div>
And a module named script that contains the following statements:
<div class = "diagram">

  import m
  a = m.x
  m.y = 10
  from m import y
  from m import z as b
  z = y
  del m.z
  c = 10
</div>
The result will be two large rounded-rectangles (objects for modules m and 
script) which contain labeled boxes that refer to other rounded-rectangles
(objects for int values), some of which are shared (referred to by multiple
names)

5. Predict what the following script will produce and explain why.
<div class = "diagram">

print(print(5))
print=1
print(print)
</div>
6a. Write a simple function named count that returns the number of times a value
is in a list; write the a simple function named indexes that returns a list of
indexes in a list that a value returns. Use the appropriate kind of for loop.
For example, count(5, [5,3,4,5,1,2,5]) returns 3; indexes(5, [5,3,4,5,1,2,5])
returns [0,3,6].

7. Suppose that we define the functions double, triple, and times10 (as done
above). Write the function call, such that call('double',5) returns the result
double(5); call('triple',5) returns the result triple(5); call('magnitude',5)
returns the result magnitude(5). Hint: use eval.

8. Write a function named between that is defined with two parameters. It
returns a reference to a function that has one parameter, which returns whether
or not its one parameter is between (inclusive) the two arguments supplied when
between is called. For example
<div class = "diagram">

college_age = between(18,22)
print( college_age(20) )

print True because 18 <= 20 <= 22.
</div>
9. Assume s = 'Fortunate'. Explain how Python evalues s.replace('t','c'). Sure,
the result it produces is 'Forcunace', but exactly how does Python know which
function to call and how to call that function with these arguments. Hint: Use
the Fundamenal Equation of Object-Oriented Programming.

9.5 This is tricky: it requires a good understanding of exec, eval, and what
characters really appear in strings when you type them on the console.
(1) prompt the user to enter a string that defines a function (using \n where
new lines would be in the function); (2) use exec to define the function;
(3) prompt the user to enter a call to the function and print what it evaluates
to. The interaction might look like:
<div class = "diagram">

Enter function definition as string: def f(n):\n    return 2*n
Enter function call as string      : f(3)
6
</div>
Hint: when you enter \n in a string, what characters are entered? Use the
replace function to "fix" them to exec will work.

10. Assume that you have a list of tuples, where each tuple is a name and
birthday: e.g., ('alex', (9, 4, 1988)) and ('mark', (11, 29, 1990)). The
birthday 3-tuple, consists of a month, followed by day, followed by year. Write
a for-loop using sorted and a lambda to print out the tuples in the list in
order of their bithdays (just months and days) so the 'alex' tuple prints
before the 'mark' tuple because September 4th comes before November 29th; all
people who have the same birthday should be printed in alphabetical order.
Hint write a lambda that uses a key that is a person's month value, followed by
a day value, followed by a name value.

11. What does the following script print?
<div class = "diagram">

print('a','b','c',sep='.-x-.')
print('d','e','f',sep='')
print('g','j','i',sep=':',end='..')
print('j','k','l',sep='--',end='?')
print('m',end='\n\n')
print('n')
</div>
12. Assume s is a string. What is the value of s[-1:0:-1]? Assume l is a list.
Write the simplest loop that prints all values in a list except the first and
last (if the list has2 or fewer values, it should print nothing).

13. Write a single Python statement using a conditional expression that is
equivalent to the following two statementso
<div class = "diagram">

t= 0
if x < 0:
    t = -1
</div>
14. What can we say about
<div class = "diagram">

  len of set(d.keys())   compared to len of d.keys?
  len of set(d.values()) compared to len of d.values()?
  len of set(d.items())  compared to len of d.items()?
</div>
15. Assume we import the copy function from the copy module. What is the
difference between the result produced by list((1,2,3)) and copy((1,2,3))?

15.5 Using the kind of pictures dicussed in the Binding section above,
illustrate the meaning of the following and determine what is printed.
<div class = "diagram">

  x = [ [0], [1]]
  y = list(x)
  x[0][0] = 'a'
  print(x,y)
</div>
16a. Assume we have a list of students (ls) and a list of their gpas (lg).
Create a dictionary whose first key is the first student in ls and whose
associated value is the first gpa in the lg; whose second key is the second
student in ls and whose associated value is the second gpa in the lg; etc.
So if ls = ['bob','carol','ted','alice'] and lg = [3.0, 3.2, 2,8, 3.6] the
resulting dict might print as {'carol': 3.2, 'ted': 2, 'alice': 8, 'bob': 3.0}.
Hint: use the dict constructor and the zip function.

16b. Assume that we have a list of runners in the order they finished the race.
For example ['bob','carol','ted','alice']. Create a dictionary whose keys are
the students and whose values are the place in which they finished. For this
example the resulting dict might print as 
{'carol': 2, 'ted': 3, 'alice': 4, 'bob': 1}. Hint: use a comprehension and
enumerate.

16c. Assume that we have a list of values l and a function f, and we want to
define a function that computes the value x in l whose f(x) is the smallest.
For example, if l = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] and def f(x) : return abs(x+1), then
calling min_v(l,f) would return -1. Hint: try to write the min_v function in one
line: a returns statement calling min, on a special comprehension, and indexing.

17. The following script uses many topics that are covered in the lecture.

Write a script that reads a multiline file of words separated by spaces
(no punctuation) and builds a dictionary whose keys are the words and whose
values are lists of the line numbers that the words are on (with no duplicate
line numbers in each list). Print all the words (in sorted order, one per line)
with the list of their line numbers afterwards. For example, the 3 line file

to be or
not to be
that is the question

would print as
<div class = "diagram">

be [1, 2]
is [3]
not [2]
or [1]
question [3]
that [3]
the [3]
to [1, 2]
</div>
My solution was 8 lines long (including one import). It used a defaultdict,
three loops, three function calls (open, enumerate, and sorted), and four
method calls (rstrip, split, append).
